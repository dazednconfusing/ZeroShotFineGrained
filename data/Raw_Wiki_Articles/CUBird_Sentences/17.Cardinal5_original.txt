cardinals, in the family cardinalidae, are passerine birds found in north and south america.
they are also known as cardinal-grosbeaks and cardinal-buntings.
the south american cardinals in the genus paroaria are placed in another family, the thraupidae (previously placed in emberizidae).

the family ranges in size from the 12 centimeters, 11.5 centimeters and up orange-breasted bunting to the 25 centimeters, 85 centimeters black-headed saltator.

the northern cardinal type species was named by colonists for the male's red crest, reminiscent of a catholic cardinal's biretta.
