0 the forster's tern (sterna forsteri) is a member of the tern family , sternidae .
1  it breeds inland in north america and winters south to the caribbean and northern south america .
2 this species is rare but annual in western europe , and has wintered in ireland and great britain on a number of occasions .
3  no european tern winters so far north .
4 this species breeds in colonies in marshes .
5  it nests in a ground scrape and lays three or more eggs .
6  like all white terns , it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young .
7 the forster's tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish , but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes .
8  it usually feeds from saline environments in winter , like most sterna terns .
9  it usually dives directly , and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by the arctic tern .
10  the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display .
11 this is a small tern , {convert|33||36|cm|in|abbr=on} long with a {convert|64||70|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
12  it is most similar to the common tern .
13  it has pale grey upperparts and white underparts .
14  its legs are red and its bill is red , tipped with black .
15  in winter , the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eye mask remains .
16  juvenile forster's terns are similar to the winter adult .
17  the call is a harsh noise like a black-headed gull .
18 this species is unlikely to be confused with the common tern in winter because of the black eye mask , but is much more similar in breeding plumage .
19  forster's has a grey centre to its white tail , and the upperwings are pure white , without the darker primary wedge of the common tern .
20 this bird is named after the naturalist johann reinhold forster .
