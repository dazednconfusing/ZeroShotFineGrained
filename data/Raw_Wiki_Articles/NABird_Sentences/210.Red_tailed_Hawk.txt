0 the red-tailed hawk (buteo jamaicensis) is a bird of prey , one of three species colloquially known in the united states as the "chickenhawk ," though it rarely preys on standard sized chickens .
1 [2] it breeds throughout most of north america , from western alaska and northern canada to as far south as panama and the west indies , and is one of the most common buteos in north america .
2  red-tailed hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range .
3  there are fourteen recognized subspecies , which vary in appearance and range .
4  it is one of the largest members of the genus buteo in north america , typically weighing from 690 to 1,600 g (1.5 to 3.5 lb) and measuring 4565 cm (1826 in) in length , with a wingspan from 110145 cm (4357 in) .
5  the red-tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size , with females averaging about 25% heavier than males .
6 [3] the bird is sometimes referred to as the red-tail for short , when the meaning is clear in context .
7 the subspecies harlan's hawk (b .
8  j .
9  harlani) is sometimes considered a separate species (b .
10  harlani) .
11 [4]the red-tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes , including deserts , grasslands , coniferous and deciduous forests , agricultural fields and urban areas .
12  it lives throughout the north american continent , except in areas of unbroken forest or the high arctic .
13  it is legally protected in canada , mexico and the united states by the migratory bird treaty act .
14 because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters , the majority of hawks captured for falconry in the united states are red-tails .
15  falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks (which have left the nest , are on their own , but are less than a year old) so as to not affect the breeding population .
16  adults , which may be breeding or rearing chicks , may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so .
17  passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed the adult behaviors which would make them more difficult to train .
18 descriptionas is the case with many raptors , the red-tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size , as females are up to 25% larger than males .
19 [5] as is typical in large raptors , frequently reported mean body mass for red-tailed hawks are somewhat higher than expansive research reveals .
20 [6] part of this weight is highly seasonally variable and due to clinal variation , male red-tailed hawks may weigh from 690 to 1,300 g (1.52 to 2.87 lb) and in females between 900 and 2,000 g (2.0 and 4.4 lb) .
21  however , research from nine studies occurring at migration sites in the united states and two breeding studies , one from the smallest race in puerto rico , the other from larger races in wisconsin show that males weigh a mean of 837 g (1.845 lb) and females weigh a mean of 1,040.7 g (2.294 lb), about 15% lighter than prior species-wide published weights .
22 [6][7][8] the heaviest surveyed weights came from migrants in cape may , new jersey , where females weighed a mean of 1,278 g (2.818 lb), males a mean of 990.8 g (2.184 lb) .
23 [7] the lightest were from the breeding population in forest openings of puerto rico , where the females and males weighed an average of 1,023 g (2.255 lb) and 795 g (1.753 lb), respectively , also the highest size sexual dimorphism in the species .
24  size variation in body mass reveals that the red-tailed hawks typically varies only a modest amount , racial variation in average weights of great horned owls show that mean body mass is nearly twice (the heaviest race is about 36% heavier than the lightest known race on average) as variable as that of the hawk (where the heaviest race is only just over 18% heavier on average than the lightest) .
25 [7][8][9] males can reportedly measure 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) in total length , females measuring 48 to 65 cm (19 to 26 in) long .
26  the wingspan can range from 105 to 141 cm (41 to 56 in) and , in the standard scientific method of measuring wing size , the wing chord is 325.1444.5 mm (12.8017.50 in) long .
27  the tail measures 188 to 258.7 mm (7.40 to 10.19 in) in length .
28 [10][11] the exposed culmen was reported to range from 21.7 to 30.2 mm (0.85 to 1.19 in) and the tarsus averaged 74.795.8 mm (2.943.77 in) .
29 [6][7][12] the middle toe (excluding talon) can range from 38.3 to 53.8 mm (1.51 to 2.12 in), with the hallux-claw (the talon of the rear toe , which has evolved to be the largest in accipitrids) measuring from 24.1 to 33.6 mm (0.95 to 1.32 in) in length .
30 [6][7]characteristic red tailred-tailed hawk plumage can be variable , depending on the subspecies and the region .
31  these color variations are morphs , and are not related to molting .
32  the western north american population , b .
33  j .
34  calurus , is the most variable subspecies and has three color morphs: light , dark , and intermediate or rufus .
35  the dark and intermediate morphs constitute 1020% of the population .
36 [13]though the markings and hue vary across the subspecies , the basic appearance of the red-tailed hawk is consistent .
37  overall , this species is blocky and broad in shape , often appearing (and being) heavier than other buteos of similar length .
38 [10] a whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across the belly , formed by horizontal streaks in feather patterning , is present in most color variations .
39  especially in younger birds , the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting .
40  the red tail , which gives this species its name , is uniformly brick-red above and light buff-orange below .
41 [10][14] the bill is short and dark , in the hooked shape characteristic of raptors , and the head can sometimes appear small in size against the thick body frame .
42 [10] they have a relatively short , broad tails and thick , chunky wings .
43 [14] the cere , the legs , and the feet of the red-tailed hawk are all yellow .
44 [5]immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises .
45  as the bird attains full maturity over the course of 34 years , the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-brown hue .
46  in both the light and dark morphs , the tail of the immature red-tailed hawk is patterned with numerous darker bars .
47 [14]taxonomyin flight showing the red tailthe red-tailed hawk is a member of the genus buteo , a group of medium-sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings .
48  members of this genus are known as buzzards in europe , but hawks in north america .

108 distribution and habitatimmature in californiaa juvenile red-tailed hawkthe red-tailed hawk is one of the most widely scattered hawks in the americas .
109  it breeds from central alaska , the yukon , and the northwest territories east to southern quebec and the maritime provinces of canada , and south to florida , the west indies , and central america .
110  the winter range stretches from southern canada south throughout the remainder of the breeding range .
111 [19]its preferred habitat is mixed forest and field , with high bluffs or trees that may be used as perch sites .
112  it occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes , including deserts , grasslands , coastal regions , mountains , foothills , coniferous and deciduous woodlands , tropical rainforests , agricultural fields and urban areas .
113 [1] it is second only to the peregrine falcon in the use of diverse habitats in north america .
114 [22] it lives throughout the north american continent , except in areas of unbroken forest or the high arctic .
115 [13]the red-tailed hawk is widespread in north america ,[22] partially due to historic settlement patterns , which have benefited it .
116  the clearing of forests in the northeast created hunting areas , while the preservation of woodlots left the species with viable nest sites .
117  the increase in trees throughout the great plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the red-tailed hawk[23] as well as range expansions of many other species of birds .
118 [24][25][26] the construction of highways with utility poles alongside treeless medians provided perfect habitat for perch-hunting .
119  unlike some other raptors , the red-tailed hawk are seemingly unfazed by considerable human activity and can nest and live in close proximity to large numbers of humans .
120 [10] thus , the species can also be found in cities , where common prey such as rock pigeons and brown rats may support their populations .
121 [27] one famous urban red-tailed hawk , known as "pale male", became the subject of a non-fiction book , red-tails in love: a wildlife drama in central park , and is the first known red-tail in decades to successfully nest and raise young in the crowded new york city borough of manhattan .
122 [28][29][30]behaviorflightin flight , this hawk soars with wings often in a slight dihedral , flapping as little as possible to conserve energy .
123  active flight is slow and deliberate , with deep wing beats .
124  in wind , it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains stationary above the ground .
125 [13] when soaring or flapping its wings , it typically travels from 32 to 64 km/h (40 mph), but when diving may exceed 190 km/h (120 mph) .
126 [31]vocalizationthe cry of the red-tailed hawk is a two to three second hoarse , rasping scream , described as kree-eee-ar ,[27] that begins at a high pitch and slurs downward .
127 [31] this cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam whistle .
128 [5] the red-tailed hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring , but vocalizes loudest in annoyance or anger , in response to a predator or a rival hawk's intrusion into its territory .
129 [27] at close range , it makes a croaking "guh-runk" .
130 [32] young hawks may utter a wailing klee-uk food cry when parents leave the nest .
131 [33] the fierce , screaming cry of the red-tailed hawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows and other media , even if the bird featured is not a red-tailed hawk .
132 [34][35]the red-tailed hawk is carnivorous , and an opportunistic feeder .
133  its diet is mainly small mammals , but it also includes birds and reptiles .
134  prey varies with regional and seasonal availability , but usually centers on rodents , comprising up to 85% of a hawk's diet .
135 [5] most commonly reported prey types include mice , including both native peromyscus species and house mice; gophers , voles , chipmunks , ground squirrels and tree squirrels .
136 [36][37] additional prey (listed by descending likelihood of predation) include lagomorphs , shrews , bats ,[38] pigeons , quail , corvids , waterfowl , other raptors , reptiles , fish , crustaceans , insects and earthworms .
137 [10] where found in caribbean islands , red-tailed hawks prey mostly on reptiles such as snakes and lizards , since these are perhaps the most predominant native land animals of that region .
138 [10] prey specimens can range to as small a size as beetles and worms .
139  however , they can also prey on marmots , white-tailed jackrabbits , or female wild turkey , all of which are at least easily double the weight of most red-tails .
140 [10] although they prefer to feed on fresh prey they've killed themselves , these hawks are not above occasionally consuming carrion .
141  during winter in captivity , an average red-tail will eat about 135 g (4.8 oz) daily .
142 [33]the red-tailed hawk commonly employs one of two hunting techniques .
143  often , they scan for prey activity from an elevated perch site , swooping down from the perch to seize the prey .
144  they also watch for prey while flying , either capturing a bird in flight or pursuing prey on the ground until they can pin them down in their talons .
145 [10] red-tailed hawks , like some other raptors , have been observed to hunt in pairs .
146  this may consist of stalking opposites sides of a tree , in order to surround a tree squirrel and almost inevitably drive the rodent to be captured by one after being flushed by the other hawk .
147 [39] they are opportunistically attracted to conspicuous meals , such as displaying male red-winged blackbirds .
148 [5]juvenile eating a squirrelthe great horned owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally to the red-tail , taking similar prey .
149  competition may occur between the hawk and owl species during twilight , although the differing nesting season and activity times usually results in a lack of direct competition .
150  although the red-tail's prey is on average larger (due in part to the scarcity of diurnal squirrels in the owl's diet),[37] the owl is an occasional predator of red-tailed hawks themselves , of any age , while the hawks are not known to predate adult great horned owls .
151 [36] other competitors include other large buteo species such as swainson's hawks and rough-legged hawks , as well as the northern goshawk , since prey and foraging methods of these species occasionally overlap .
152 [40][41] hawks have been observed following american badgers to capture prey they flush and the two are considered potential competitors .
153 [42] competition over carcasses may occur with american crows , and several crows working together can displace a hawk .
154 [43] larger raptors , such as eagles and ferruginous hawks , may steal hawk kills .
155 [5]reproductionterritorial adult chasing away an immature red-tailed hawkthe red-tailed hawk reaches sexual maturity at two years of age .
156  it is monogamous , mating with the same individual for many years .
157  in general , the red-tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies .
158 [44] the same nesting territory may be defended by the pair for years .
159  during courtship , the male and female fly in wide circles while uttering shrill cries .
160  the male performs aerial displays , diving steeply , and then climbing again .
161  after repeating this display several times , he sometimes grasps her talons briefly with his own .
162  courtship flights can last 10 minutes or more .
163  copulation often follows courtship flight sequences , although copulation frequently occurs in the absence of courtship flights .
164 in copulation , the female , when perched , tilts forward , allowing the male to land with his feet lodged on her horizontal back .
165  the female twists and moves her tail feathers to one side , while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female's cloaca .
166  copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day .
167 [45]in the same period , the pair constructs a stick nest in a large tree 4 to 21 m (13 to 69 ft) off the ground or on a cliff ledge 35 m (115 ft) or higher above the ground , or may nest on man-made structures .
168  the nest is generally 71 to 97 cm (28 to 38 in) in diameter and can be up to 90 cm (3.0 ft) tall .
169  the nest is constructed of twigs , and lined with bark , pine needles , corn cobs , husks , stalks , aspen catkins , or other plant lining matter .
170 great horned owls compete with the red-tailed hawk for nest sites .
171  each species has been known to kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other , but in general , both species nest in adjacent or confluent territories without conflict .
172  great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and typically expropriate existing red-tail nests .
173  great horned owls begin nesting behaviors much earlier than red-tails , often as early as december .
174  red-tails are therefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year's nest has been overtaken by owls or otherwise lost .
175  new nests are typically within a kilometer or less of the previous nest .
176  often , a new nest is only a few hundred meters or less from a previous one .
177  being a large predator , most predation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings , which are taken by owls , corvids and raccoons .
178 [46]parent in nest with chicksa clutch of one to three eggs is laid in march or april , depending upon latitude .
179  clutch size depends almost exclusively on the availability of prey for the adults .
180  eggs are laid approximately every other day .
181  the eggs are usually about 60 mm  47 mm (2.4 in  1.9 in) .
182  they are incubated primarily by female , with the male substituting when the female leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings .
183  the male brings most food to the female while she incubates .
184  after 28 to 35 days , the eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days; the nestlings are altricial at hatching .
185  the female broods them while the male provides most of the food to the female and the young , which are known as eyasses (pronounced "eye-ess-ez") .
186  the female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces .
187  after 42 to 46 days , the eyasses begin to leave the nest .
188  the fledging period follows , with short flights engaged in , after another 3 weeks .
189  about 6 to 7 weeks after fledging , the young begin to capture their own prey .
190  shortly thereafter , when the young are around 4 months of age , they become independent of their parents .
191  however , the hawks do not generally reach breeding maturity until they are around 3 years of age .
192  in the wild , red-tailed hawks have lived for at least 25 years , for example , pale male was born in 1990, and in spring 2014 is still raising eyasses .
193  the oldest captive hawk of this species was at least 29 and a half years of age .

195 use in falconrythe red-tailed hawk is a popular bird in falconry , particularly in the united states where the sport of falconry is tightly regulated and where red-tailed hawks are both widely available and allowed to novice falconers .
196  red-tailed hawks are highly tameable and trainable , with a more social disposition than all other falcons or hawks other than the harris's hawk .
197 [47] they are also long lived and highly disease resistant , allowing a falconer to maintain a red-tailed hawk as a hunting companion for many years .
198  there are fewer than 5,000 falconers in the united states , so despite their popularity any effect on the red-tailed hawk population , estimated to be about one million in the united states , is negligible .
199 [48]not being as swift as falcons or accipiters , red-tailed hawks are not the most effective of bird hawks and are usually used against ground game such as rabbits and squirrels .
200  however , some individuals may learn to ambush birds on the ground with a swift surprise approach and capture them before they can accelerate to full speed and escape .
201  some have even learned to use a falcon-like diving stoop to capture challenging game such as pheasants .
202  in the course of a typical hunt , a falconer using a red-tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point .
203  the falconer , who may be aided by a dog , then attempts to flush prey by stirring up ground cover .
204  a well-trained red-tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog , realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game .
205  once a raptor catches game , it does not bring it back to the falconer .
206  instead , the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey , "make in" (carefully approach) and trade the bird its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat .
207 [49]feathers and native american usethe feathers and other parts of the red-tailed hawk are considered sacred to many american indigenous people and , like the feathers of the bald eagle and golden eagle , are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the regalia of many native americans in the united states; these parts , most especially their distinctive tail feathers , are a popular item in the native american community .
208 [50] as with the other two species , the feathers and parts of the red-tailed hawk are regulated by the eagle feather law ,[51] which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds .
