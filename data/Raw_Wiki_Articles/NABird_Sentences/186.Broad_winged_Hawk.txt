0 the broad-winged hawk (buteo platypterus) is a small hawk of the genus buteo .
1  during the summer , some subspecies are distributed over eastern north america , as far west as british columbia and texas; they then migrate south to winter in the neotropics from mexico down to southern brazil .
2 [2] other subspecies are all-year residents on caribbean islands .
3 [citation needed] as in most raptors , females are slightly larger than males .
4  broad-winged hawks' wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered , somewhat pointed appearance .
5  there are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall .
6  although the broad-winged hawk's numbers are relatively stable , populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation .
7 descriptionthe broad-winged hawk is a relatively small buteo , with a body size from 32 to 44 cm (13 to 17 in) in length and weighing anywhere from 265 to 560 g (9.3 to 19.8 oz) .
8  the tail is relatively short , measuring 14.519 cm (5.77.5 in) in length .
9  the tarsus measures from 5.6 to 6.6 cm (2.2 to 2.6 in) .
10 [3][4] as in most raptors , females are slightly larger than males .
11 [5] broad-winged hawks have relatively short and broad wings , pointed at the end , which have a tapered appearance unique to the species .
12  the wingspan can range from 74 to 100 cm (29 to 39 in), with the extended wing bone (standard measurement) measuring 22.730 cm (8.911.8 in) .
13 [4] adults' bodies are a dark brown with a white belly and chest containing horizontal barring .
14  their tail can be a dark grey-black with white lines along the middle , base and tip .
15 [4] the young hawks have a slightly different colouring with more white and longitudinal barring instead of horizontal barring .
16  there are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall .
17 [2] the light morph of this bird is most likely to be confused with the red-shouldered hawk , but they have a longer , more heavily barred tail and wings with a solid rufous colour in the adult which are usually distinctive .
18 [2] rare dark morphs are a darker brown on both upperparts and underparts .
19  dark-morph short-tailed hawks are similar but are whitish under the tail with a single subterminal band .
20 [4]taxonomythis species , buteo platypterus , is in the family accipitridae , which is placed in the order falconiformes (or accipitriformes) .
21  currently the species is split up into six subspecies;[6] each is named for its distribution ,[citation needed] as listed below:[6][7]b .

40 habitat and distributionbroad-winged hawks have a wide range in north america and south america , from southern canada to southern brazil .
41  their breeding range is in the northern and eastern parts of north america and some , not all , migrate in the winter to florida , southern mexico and northern south america .
42 [9][10] there are five subspecies that are endemic to the caribbean that do not migrate .
43  thus , broad-winged hawks are partial migrants .
44 [citation needed] those subspecies that do migrate will fly in flocks of more than forty up to hundreds of thousands at heights anywhere from 550 m (1,800 ft) to approximately 1,300 m (4,300 ft) .
45  they soar using thermals to carry them through their journey of 3,0006,000 km (1,9003,700 mi) .
46 [11] fall migration lasts for 70 days as birds migrate about 100 km (62 mi) per day from north america , through central america to south america without crossing salt water .
47 [12] the enormous flocks of soaring broad-winged hawks are termed kettles and are characteristic of many hawk migration spectacles in north america , such as at hawk cliff in ontario , hawk ridge in minnesota , hawk mountain in pennsylvania , and the river of raptors in veracruz .
48 broad-winged hawks stay in areas up to an elevation of about 2,000 m (6,600 ft) .
49  they breed in deciduous forests good for nesting and forage primarily in wetlands and meadows .
50  while some birds have acclimatized themselves to living near humans even those birds avoid human settlements and interactions .
51  in the winter the migrating subspecies of the hawks seek out similar conditions to their overwintering home , so they settle in deciduous and mixed forests .
52 [13]although the broad-winged hawk's numbers are relatively stable , populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation .
53  since there are no threats to its survival , it is assessed as least concern on the iucn red list .
54 [1]behaviourvocalizationthese hawks use vocalizations for communication with their mates and offspring .
55  also in territorial displays towards intruders like red-tailed hawks or other threatening animals .
56  the call sounds like a very high pitched kee-ee , almost like a whistle .
57  when confronted with a threat broad-winged hawks will emit an alarm call consisting of stuttered and squealing whistles .
58 [citation needed]broad-winged hawks are carnivores .
59  the types of food they eat depends on the time of year .
60  during the summer or nesting season the parents and ultimately their chicks will eat small mammals , such as chipmunks , shrews , and voles , frogs , lizards , and sometimes even other nesting birds .
61 [14] in the winter months broad-winged hawks have been observed feeding on insects , frogs , snakes , crabs , and some small mammals .
62  to catch their prey , broad-winged hawks will watch from low branches hiding in the foliage until a target is spotted .
63  from their roost they will do a short fast glide to capture the prey .
64  they give special attention to preparing their food for consumption , skinning frogs and snakes and plucking prey birds' feathers .
65  most small mammals on the other hand will be eaten whole .
66  they rarely drink water and are able to survive solely with the water present in their prey .
67 reproductionthese birds will have only one mate during the breeding season , possibly because the male also helps a small amount with the rearing of the chicks .
68 [15] they will breed between april and august starting when they reach sexual maturity at about two years old .
69 [15]to attract and court females , the males will perform a courtship display flight including cartwheels , dives , and other aerial acrobatics .
70  birds meet in the air , hook their feet together and spiral down together .
71 [16] they will also compete and fight with other males for the chance to mate with a female .
72  if one of the males is successful , the mating pair will have only one brood that season consisting of one to four eggs .
73 [15]both the male and female will build the nest out of sticks and twigs in a deciduous tree .
74  once laid , the brown-spotted eggs are usually 49 mm  39 mm (1.9 in  1.5 in) and weigh about 42 g (1.5 oz) .
75  the female will then develop a brood patch and incubate the eggs for 28 days or longer before they hatch .
76 the hatchlings will appear semi-altricial; incapable of any complex coordination but have open eyes and are covered in down feathers .
77 [17] chicks will have rapid body growth until they are almost at adult body size at which time they are capable of walking , flying and eating without parental help .
78 [17] while in the nest the female gives most of the parental care , protecting and taking care of the chicks .
79  it is not unusual to have the male provide some food for the female and offspring but his visits are short lived .
80 once a prey item is obtained for the nest , the female will tear off pieces and will feed the chicks until they are able to rip meat off on their own .
81  often the chicks will fight for possession of the offered morsel , the younger ones usually losing and not getting enough .
82 [18]broad-winged hawks will protect their nests in a show of aggression (i .
83 e .
84  diving and chasing) towards any suspected threat but they generally will not make physical contact .
85 [19] predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons , crows , porcupines and american black bears .
86  adults have been known to fall to red-tailed hawks , great horned owls , bald eagles , and golden eagles .
87 [6] it will take the hatchlings five to six weeks before they are able to leave the nest .
88  some young , even after that time , will remain in the area of the nest for several weeks more .
