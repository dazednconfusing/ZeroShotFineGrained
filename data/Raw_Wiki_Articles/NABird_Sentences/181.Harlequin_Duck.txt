16  the nest is usually located in a well-concealed location on the ground near a stream .
17  they are usually found near pounding surf and white water .
18  they are short distance migrants and most winter near rocky shorelines on the atlantic and pacific coasts .
19  they are very rare migrants to western europe .
20 the eastern north american population is declining and is considered endangered .
21  possible causes include loss of habitat due to hydroelectric projects and loss of life due to oil spills near coastal areas .
22 behaviourthese birds feed by swimming under water or diving .
23  they also dabble .
24  they eat molluscs , crustaceans and insects .
25  harlequins have smooth , densely packed feathers that trap a lot of air within them .
26  this is vital for insulating such small bodies against the chilly waters they ply .
27  it also makes them exceptionally buoyant , making them bounce like corks after dives .
28 taxonomytoday , this is the only species of its genus .
29  two prehistoric harlequin ducks were described from fossils , although both were initially placed in a distinct genus: histrionicus shotwelli is known from middle to late miocene deposits of oregon , usa and was considered to form a distinct monotypic genus , ocyplonessa .
30  histrionicus ceruttii , which lived in california during the late pliocene , was at first taken to be a species of the related genus melanitta .
31  the species is traditionally considered monotypic .
32  the eastern and western populations are sometimes recognized as two different subspecies , the eastern race being the nominate h .
33  histrionicus histrionicus , and the western race as h .
34  h .
35  pacificus , but there has been doubt on the validity of this taxon .
