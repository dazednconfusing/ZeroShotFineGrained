0 the eastern meadowlark (sturnella magna) is a medium-sized icterid bird , very similar in appearance to the western meadowlark .
1  it occurs from eastern north america to south america , where it is also most widespread in the east .
2 ==description==the adult eastern meadowlark measures from {convert|19|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and spans {convert|35|-|40|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wings .
3  body mass ranges from {convert|76|to|150|g|oz|abbr=on} .
4  the extended wing bone measures {convert|8.9|-|12.9|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail measures {convert|5.3|-|8.6|cm|in|abbr=on}, the culmen measures {convert|2.8|-|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus measures {convert|3.6|-|4.7|cm|in|abbr=on} .
5  females are smaller in all physical dimensions .
6  adults have yellow underparts with a black "v" on the breast and white flanks with black streaks .
7  the upperparts are mainly brown with black streaks .
8  they have a long pointed bill; the head is striped with light brown and black .
9 the song of this bird is of pure , melancholy whistles , and thus simpler than the jumbled and flutey song of the western meadowlark; their ranges overlap across central north america .
10  in the field , the song is often the easiest way to tell the two species apart , though plumage differences do exist , like tail pattern and malar coloration .
11 the pale lilian's meadowlark of northern mexico and the southwestern us is sometimes split off as a separate species .
12 ==taxonomy==this species was first described by linnaeus in his 1758 systema naturae as alauda magna .
13  the type locality is mistakenly given as "america , africa" .
14 linnaeus' error is explained by two facts: first , he did not distinguish between the eastern and western meadowlarks .
15  the peculiar belief that this bird also occurred in africa is due to confusion of the yellow-breasted meadowlarks with certain longclaws (macronyx), quite unrelated african songbirds .
16  specifically the cape longclaw (m .
17  capensis) and the yellow-throated longclaw (m .
18  croceus) share similar habitat and habits , explaining the long hind toe; their plumage pattern however is all but identical , a striking example of convergent evolution .
19  as this exact pattern provides no obvious adaptive benefit compared to that of other meadowlarks and longclaws , it seems to have arisen twice by sheer chance .
20 linnaeus recognized his error less than a decade later , separating the longclaws from their meadowlark look-alikes .
21 the scientific name sturnella magna is latin for , rather confusingly , "large little starling", the generic name having been given due to the meadowlarks' behavior being similar to starlings .
22 ==ecology==their breeding habitat is grasslands and prairie , also pastures and hay fields .
23  this species is a permanent resident throughout much of its range , though most northern birds migrate southwards in winter .
24    in 1993 this species was first recorded in el salvador , and the discovery of a breeding pair in 2004 confirmed that the species is a resident there .
25 these birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation , sometimes probing with the bill .
26  they mainly eat arthropods , but also seeds and berries .
27  in winter , they often feed in flocks .
28 nesting occurs throughout the summer months .
29  the nest is also on the ground , covered with a roof woven from grasses .
30  there may be more than one nesting female in a male's territory .
31 the numbers of this species increased as forests were cleared in eastern north america .
32  this species is ideally suited to farmland areas , especially where tall grasses are allowed to grow .
33  their numbers are now shrinking with a decline in suitable habitat .
34  on the other hand , its range is expanding in parts of central america toward the pacific (western) side of the continent , in agricultural-type areas .
35 == conservation efforts ==eastern meadowlarks are species at risk in nova scotia and the subject of agricultural conservation program seeking to reduce mortality through modified practices .
36  allowing marginal areas of fields on farms to seed with grass can provide nesting habitat for meadowlarks and all grassland birds .
