0 the northern saw-whet owl (aegolius acadicus) is a small owl native to north america .
1 ==description==the scientific description of one of the sub-species of this owl is attributed to the rev .
2  john henry keen who was a missionary in canada in 1896. adults are {convert|17|-|22|cm|in|abbr=on} long with a {convert|42|-|56.3|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
3  they can weigh from {convert|54|to|151|g|oz|abbr=on} with an average of around {convert|80|g|oz|abbr=on}, making them one of the smallest owls in north america .
4  they are close to the size of an american robin .
5  the northern saw-whet owl has a round , light , white face with brown and cream streaks; they also have a dark beak and yellow eyes .
6  they resemble the short-eared owl , because they also lack ear tufts , but are much smaller .
7  the underparts are pale with dark shaded areas; the upper parts are brown or reddish with white spots .
8  they are quite common , but hard to spot .
9 ==voice==the northern saw-whet owl makes a repeated tooting whistle sound .
10  some say they sound like a saw being sharpened on a whetstone .
11  they usually make these sounds to find a mate , so they can be heard more often april through june when they are looking for mates .
12  despite being more common in spring , they do vocalize year round .
13 ==hearing==the northern saw-whet owl has a very sophisticated hearing .
14   it is due to vertically asymmetrical ears and different shape of the ear openings .
15   because the sound reaches the ears at a different time and is of different intensity , the northern saw-whet owl can very precisely localize its prey .
16   such accurate sound localization allows it to hunt in a complete darkness by hearing alone .
17  ==habitat==their habitat is coniferous forests , sometimes mixed or deciduous woods , across north america .
18  most birds nest in coniferous type forests of the north but winter in mixed or deciduous woods .
19  they also love riparian areas because of the abundance of prey there .
20  they live in tree cavities and old nests made by other small raptors .
21  some are permanent residents , while others may migrate south in winter or move down from higher elevations .
22  their range covers most of north america including southeastern alaska , southern canada , most of the united states and the central mountains in mexico .
23  the invisible map shows where they breed and the areas where they can live throughout the year .
24 some have begun to move more southeast in indiana and neighboring states .
25  buidin et al .
26  did a study of how far north the northern saw-whet owls breed and they found that they can breed northward to > 50 n , farther than ever recorded before .
27  their range is quite extensive and they can even breed in the far north where most birds migrate from to breed .
28  they are an adaptive species that can do well in the cold .
29 ==nesting==northern saw-whet owls lay about 56 white colored eggs in natural tree cavities or woodpecker holes .
30  the father does the hunting while the mother watches and sits on her eggs .
31  females can have more than one clutch of eggs each breeding season with different males .
32  once the offspring in the first nest have developed their feathers the mother will leave the father to care for them and go find another male to reproduce with .
33  this type of mating is sequential polyandry .
34  they compete with boreal owls , starlings and squirrels for nest cavities and their nests may be destroyed or eaten by those creatures as well as nest predators such as martens and corvids .
35  saw-whet owls of all ages may be predated by any larger species of owl , of which there are at least a dozen that overlap in range .
36  they are also predated by accipiter hawks , which share with the saw-whet a preference for wooded habitats with dense thickets or brush .
37 ==feeding==these birds wait on a high perch at night and swoop down on prey .
38  they mainly eat small organisms with a focus on small mammals in their diet .
39  a test done by swengel and swengel found that the northern saw-whet owls most often eat deer mice , 67% and voles , 16% of the time in wisconsin .
40  a similar test done by holt and leroux in montana found that these owls ate more voles than other mammal species .
41  this shows that these owls can change their main prey depending on what is available .
42  also researched by holt and leroux was the eating habits of northern saw-whet owls and northern pygmy owls and found that they prey on different animals for their main food source , showing that they can adapt not only depending on the prey but also with the other predators in the areas where they live .
43 other mammals preyed on occasionally include shrews , squirrels (largely chipmunks and red squirrels), various other mice species , flying squirrels , moles and bats .
44  also supplementing the diet are small birds , with passerines such as swallows , sparrows , kinglets and chickadees favored .
45  however , larger birds , up to the size of rock pigeon (which are typically about 4 times as heavy as a saw-whet) can even be taken .
46  on the pacific coast they may also eat crustaceans , frogs and aquatic insects .
47  like many owls , these birds have excellent hearing and exceptional vision in low light .
48 ==in popular culture==martin from the "guardians of ga'hoole" novel series is a northern saw-whet owl .
49 the call of the saw-whet owl is mentioned in the grateful dead song "unbroken chain" on their album grateful dead from the mars hotel .
