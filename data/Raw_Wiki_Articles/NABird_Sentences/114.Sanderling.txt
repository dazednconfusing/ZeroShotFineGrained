0 the sanderling (calidris alba) is a small wading bird .
1  the name derives from old english sand-yrling , "sand-ploughman" .
2 [2] the genus name is from ancient greek kalidris or skalidris , a term used by aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds .
3  the specific alba is latin for "white" .
4 [3]it is a circumpolar arctic breeder , and is a long-distance migrant , wintering south to south america , south europe , africa , and australia .
5  it is highly gregarious in winter , sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches .
6 it is somewhat unlike other sandpipers in appearance , which has led to the suggestion that it should be placed into a monotypic genus crocethia .
7  a more recent review (thomas et al .
8 , 2004) indicates , however , that the sanderling is a fairly typical "stint" or small sandpiper and should be separated from the large knots with its closest relatives in a distinct genus .
9 this bird is similar in size to a dunlin , but stouter , with a thick bill .
10  it shows a strong white wingbar in flight , and runs along the sandy beaches it prefers with a characteristic "bicycling" action of its legs , stopping frequently to pick small food items .
11  it eats small crabs and other small invertebrates .
12  in spring , birds migrating north from south america consume large numbers of horseshoe crab eggs in the delaware bay area .
13 in spring , the birds arrive on the high arctic breeding grounds (see map), where they lay 34 eggs in a ground scrape .
14  on the nesting grounds , these birds mainly eat insects and some plant material .
15 the sanderling is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
16 descriptionthe sanderling is a small plump sandpiper , 1820 cm (7.17.9 in) in length .
17  its weight ranges from 40100 g (1.43.5 oz) .
18  the winter bird is very pale , almost white apart from a dark shoulder patch .
19  this is the source of the specific name , alba , which is the latin for "white" .
20  later in the summer , the face and throat become brick-red .
21  the juvenile bird is spangled black and white , and shows much more contrast than the adult .

23  it can be told from other small wading birds , given good views , by its lack of a hind toe .
24  its behavior is also distinctive .
25 distribution , habitat and migrationsanderlings at ocean beach , san franciscothe sanderling breeds in the high arctic areas of north america , europe and asia .
26  in north america , it breeds in the canadian arctic archipelago , nunavut , greenland (and to a lesser extent alaska) .
27  in eurasia , it breeds in spitsbergen and areas of northern russia from the taymyr peninsula to the new siberian islands .
28  in the northern winter , it has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution across the world's marine coasts .
29  it is a complete migrant , travelling between 3,000 to 10,000 km (1,900 to 6,200 mi) from its breeding grounds to its wintering sites .
30  birds that travel further also arrive later and leave sooner .
31  most adults leave the breeding grounds in july and early august , whereas juvenile birds leave in late august and early september .
32  the northward migration begins in march at the southern end of their winter distribution .
33 [6]the breeding habitat of the sanderling is coastal tundra north of 5 c (41 f) july isotherm .
34  the species typically chooses nesting sites on dry stony areas near wet areas , from 60 m (200 ft) above sea level to 800 m (2,600 ft) .
35  during the winter and its migration , it is most commonly found on coastal sandy beaches , but also occurs on tidal sand flats , mud flats and the shores of lakes and rivers .
36  more infrequently , it may occur on rocky shores .
37 [6]subspeciesthe sanderling consists of two subspecies:behaviourfeeding behavioursanderlings feed on invertebrate prey buried in the sand in the upper intertidal zone .
38  in north america , this diet largely consists of the isopods excirolana linguifrons , excirolana kincaidii , and the mole crab , emerita analoga .
39  when the tide is out , these crustaceans live in burrows some way beneath the surface .
40  when the tide comes in , they move into the upper layers of sand and feed on the plankton and detritus that washes over them with each wave .
41  they then burrow rapidly down again as the water retreats .
42  they leave no marks on the surface , so the sanderlings hunt for them by plunging their beaks into the sand at random , consuming whatever they find .
43  their bills can penetrate only 2 or 3 cm (0.79 or 1.18 in) and as the water swirls around and retreats , the sand is softer; this makes it easier for the birds' beaks to penetrate further .
44  in the spring , when much breeding activity is taking place in the benthic community , there may be as many as 4000 invertebrates per square metre , but their average size is smaller than later in the year .
45  the birds appear to rush madly around at the edge of the surf , but in reality they are maximising their chances of catching as many prey animals as possible when they are at their most vulnerable near the surface .
46 [7]breeding behaviourat breeding time sanderlings are territorial , with the male aggressively defending its territory .
47  they may either form monogamous pairs or polyandrous (one female and two male) pairings .
