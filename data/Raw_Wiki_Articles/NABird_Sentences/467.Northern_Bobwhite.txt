0 the northern bobwhite , virginia quail or (in its home range) bobwhite quail (colinus virginianus) is a ground-dwelling bird native to the united states , mexico , and the caribbean .
1  it is a member of the group of species known as new world quails (odontophoridae) .
2  they were initially placed with the old world quails in the pheasant family (phasianidae), but are not particularly closely related .
3  the name "bobwhite" derives from its characteristic whistling call .
4  despite its secretive nature , the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern north america because it is frequently the only quail in its range .
5  there are 21 subspecies of northern bobwhite , many of which are hunted extensively as game birds .
6  one subspecies , the masked bobwhite (colinus virginianus ridgwayi), is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern mexican state of sonora and a reintroduced population in buenos aires national wildlife refuge in southern arizona .
7 ==description==this is a moderately-sized quail and is the only small galliform native to eastern north america .
8  the bobwhite can range from {convert|24|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on} in length with a {convert|33|to|38|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
9  as indicated by body mass , weights increase in birds found further north , as corresponds to bergmann's rule .
10  in mexico , northern bobwhites weigh from {convert|129|to|159|g|oz|abbr=on} whereas in the north they average {convert|170|to|173|g|oz|abbr=on} and large males can attain as much as {convert|255|g|oz|abbr=on} .
11  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|9.7|to|11.7|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|5|to|6.8|cm|in|abbr=on} the culmen is {convert|1.3|to|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2.7|to|3.3|cm|in|abbr=on} .
12  it has the typical chunky , rounded shape of a quail .
13  the bill is short , curved and brown-black in color .
14  this species is sexually dimorphic .
15  males have a white throat and brow stripe bordered by black .
16  the overall rufous plumage has gray mottling on the wings , white scalloped stripes on the flanks , and black scallops on the whitish underparts .
17  the tail is gray .
18  females are similar but are duller overall and have a buff throat and brow without the black border .
19  both sexes have pale legs and feet .
20 ==taxonomy=====subspecies===there are twenty-one recognized subspecies in 3 groups .
21  1 subspecies is extinct .
22 ==diet==the northern bobwhite's diet consists of plants and small invertebrates , such as snails , grasshoppers , and potato beetles .
23  plant sources include grass seeds , wild berries , partridge peas , and cultivated grains .
24  it forages on the ground in open areas with some spots of taller vegetation .
25 ==habitat==the northern bobwhite can be found year-round in agricultural fields , grassland , open woodland areas , roadsides and wood edges .
26  its range covers the southeastern quadrant of the united states from the great lakes and southern minnesota east to pennsylvania and southern massachusetts , and extending west to southern nebraska , kansas , oklahoma and all but westernmost texas .
27  it is absent from the southern tip of florida and the highest elevations of the appalachian mountains , but occurs in eastern mexico and in cuba .
28  isolated populations have been introduced in oregon and washington .
29  the northern bobwhite has also been introduced to new zealand .
30 ==vocalizations==the clear whistle "bob-white" or "bob-bob-white" call is very recognizable .
31  the syllables are slow and widely spaced , rising in pitch a full octave from beginning to end .
32  other calls include lisps , peeps , and more rapidly whistled warning calls .
33 ==behavior==like most game birds , the northern bobwhite is shy and elusive .
34  when threatened , it will crouch and freeze , relying on camouflage to stay undetected , but will flush into low flight if closely disturbed .
35  it is generally solitary or paired early in the year , but family groups are common in the late summer and winter roosts may have two dozen or more birds in a single covey .
36 ==reproduction==the species is generally monogamous , but there is some evidence of polygamy .
37  both parents incubate a brood for 23 to 24 days , and the precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching .
38  both parents lead the young birds to food and care for them for 14 to 16 days until their first flight .
39  a pair may raise one or two broods annually , with 12 to 16 eggs per clutch .
40 ==introduced populations===== european union ===northern bobwhite were introduced into italy in 1927, and are reported in the plains and hills in the northwest of the country .
41  other reports from the eu are in france , spain , and yugoslavia .
42  as bobwhites are highly productive and popular aviary subjects , it is reasonable to expect other introductions have been made in other parts of the eu , especially in the uk and ireland , where game-bird breeding , liberation , and naturalisation are relatively common practices .
43 {asf|date=april 2014}=== new zealand ===from 1898 to 1902, some 1300 birds were imported from america and released in many parts of the north and south islands , from northland to southland .
44  the bird was briefly on the nelson game shooting licence , but: "it would seem that the committee was a little too eager in placing these quail on the licence , or the shooters of the day were over-zealous and greedy in their bag limits , for the virginian quail , like the mountain quail were soon thing of the past .
45 " the taranaki (acclimatisation) society released a few in 1900 and was confidant that in a year or two they might offer good sport; two years later , broods were reported and the species was said to be steadily increasing; but after another two years they seemed to have disappeared and that was the end of them .
46  the otago (acclimatisation) society imported more in 1948, but these releases did no good .
47  after 1923, no more genuinely wild birds were sighted until 1952, when a small population was found north-west of wairoa in the ruapapa road area .
48  since then bobwhite have been found at several localities around waikaremoana , in farmland , open bush and along roadsides .
49 more birds have been imported into new zealand by private individuals since the 1990s and a healthy captive population is now held by backyard aviculturalists and have been found to be easily cared for , bred , and are popular for their song and good-looks .
50  a larger proportion of the national captive population belong to a few game preserves and game bird breeders .
51  though the birds would be self-sustaining in the wild if they were protected; it is tricky to guess what the effect of an annual population subsidy and hunting has on any of the original populations from the acclimatisation society releases .
52  it would be fair to suggest most birds in the wild are no more than one generation from captive stock .
53 an albino hen was present in a covey in bayview , hawkes bay for a couple of seasons sometime around 2000.=== captive populations ===bobwhites are popular throughout the world , with healthy captive populations everywhere where bird-keeping is enjoyed .
54  certain countries/states require permits and record keeping , as the possibility that an introduced population may compete with or spread diseases with native quail is a real threat .
55 ==captivity===== housing ===bobwhites are generally compatible with most parrots , softbills and doves .
56  this species should , however , be the only ground-dwelling species in the aviary .
57  most individuals will do little damage to finches , but one should watch that nests are not being crushed when the species perches at night .
58  single pairs are preferred , unless the birds have been raised together as a group since they were chicks .
59  some fighting will occur between cocks at breeding time .
60  one cock may be capable of servicing several hens at once , but the fertility seems to be highest in the eggs from the preferred hen .
61  aviary style is a compromise between what is tolerated by the bird and what is best for the bird .
62  open parrot-style type aviaries may be used , but some birds will remain flighty and shy in this situation .
63  in a planted aviary , this species will generally settle down to become quite tame and confiding .
64  parents with chicks will roost on the ground , forming a circular arrangement , with heads facing outwards .
65  in the early morning and late afternoon , the cock will utter its call , which , although not loud , carries well and may offend noise-sensitive neighbors .
66  most breeding facilities keep birds in breeding groups , on wire up off the ground .
67  this keeps the birds clean and generally avoids diseases and parasites which can devastate a covey .
68  cages with mesh floors for pairs and trios are also employed , but usually where there is a photo-period manipulation to keep birds breeding through winter .
69 === feeding ===in the wild the bobwhite feeds on a variety of seeds of weeds , grasses , as well as insects .
70  these are generally collected on the ground or from low foliage .
71  birds in the aviary are easily catered for with a commercial small seed mix (finch , budgerigar , or small parrot mix) when supplemented with greenfeed .
72  live food is not usually necessary for breeding , but will be ravenously accepted .
73  high protein foods such as chicken grower crumble are more convenient to supply and will be useful for the stimulation of breeding birds .
74  extra calcium is required , especially by laying hens; it can be supplied in the form of shell grit , or cuttlefish bone .
75 === breeding ===in an open aviary hens will lay all over the show if a nesting site and privacy are not provided .
76  hens that do this may lay upwards of 80 eggs in a season which can be taken for artificial incubation -  and chicks hand raised .
77  otherwise hens with nesting cover , that do make a nest (on the ground) will build up 825 eggs in a clutch , with eggs being laid daily .
78 === mutations and hybrids ===some captive bobwhite hybrids recorded are between blue quail (scaled quail), gambel's quail , california quail , mountain quail and it has long been suggested that there are japanese quail hybrids being bred commercially; there is a distinct lack of photographic proof to substantiate this .
79  inter-subspecific hybrids have been common .
80 several mutations have long been established , including californian jumbo , wisconsin jumbo , northern giant , albino , snowflake , blonde , fawn , barred , silver , and red .
81 ==similar species==the central american spot-bellied bobwhite looks very similar , but lacks black facial coloration .
82  the asian rain quail is smaller in size and has a black breast .
