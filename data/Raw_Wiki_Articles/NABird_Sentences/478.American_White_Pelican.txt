0 the american white pelican (pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is a large aquatic soaring bird from the order pelecaniformes .
1  it breeds in interior north america , moving south and to the coasts , as far as central america and south america , in winter .
2 ==taxonomy==the german naturalist johann friedrich gmelin described the american white pelican in 1789. the scientific name means "red-billed pelican", from the latin term for a pelican , pelecanus , and erythrorhynchos , derived from the ancient greek words erythros (, "red") + rhynchos (, "bill") .
3 ==description== the american white pelican rivals the trumpeter swan , with a similar overall length , as the longest bird native to north america .
4  both very large and plump , it has an overall length is about {convert|50|-|70|in|cm|abbr=on}, courtesy of the huge beak which measures {convert|11.3|-|15.2|in|mm|abbr=on} in males and {convert|10.3|-|14.2|in|mm|abbr=on} in females .
5  it has a wingspan of about {convert|95|-|120|in|cm|abbr=on} .
6  the species also has the second largest average wingspan of any north american bird , after the california condor .
7  this large wingspan allows the bird to easily use soaring flight for migration .
8   body weight can range between {convert|7.7|and|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}, although typically these birds average between {convert|11|and|20|lb|kg|abbr=on} .
9  one mean body mass of {convert|15.4|lb|kg|abbr=on} was reported .
10  another study found mean weights to be somewhat lower than expected , with eleven males averaging {convert|13.97|lb|kg|abbr=on} and six females averaging {convert|10.95|lb|kg|lb|abbr=on} .
11  among standard measurements , the wing chord measures {convert|20|-|26.7|in|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus measures {convert|3.9|-|5.4|in|cm|in|abbr=on} long .
12  the plumage is almost entirely bright white , except the black primary and secondary remiges , which are hardly visible except in flight .
13  from early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer , the breast feathers have a yellowish hue .
14  after moulting into the eclipse plumage , the upper head often has a grey hue , as blackish feathers grow between the small wispy white crest .
15 the bill is huge and flat on the top , with a large throat sac below , and , in the breeding season , is vivid orange in color as is the iris , the bare skin around the eye , and the feet .
16  in the breeding season , there is a laterally flattened "horn" on the upper bill , located about one-third the bill's length behind the tip .
17  this is the only one of the eight species of pelican to have a bill "horn" .
18  the horn is shed after the birds have mated and laid their eggs .
19  outside the breeding season the bare parts become duller in color , with the naked facial skin yellow and the bill , pouch , and feet an orangy-flesh color .
20 apart from the difference in size , males and females look exactly alike .
21  immature birds have light grey plumage with darker brownish nape and remiges .
22  their bare parts are dull grey .
23  chicks are naked at first , then grow white down feathers all over , before moulting to the immature plumage .
24 ==distribution and ecology==american white pelicans nest in colonies of several hundred pairs on islands in remote brackish and freshwater lakes of inland north america .
25  the most northerly nesting colony can be found on islands in the rapids of the slave river between fort fitzgerald , alberta , and fort smith , northwest territories .
26  about 1020% of the population uses gunnison island in the great basin's great salt lake as a nesting ground .
27  the southernmost colonies are in southwestern ontario and northeastern california .
28  nesting colonies exist as far south as albany county in southern wyoming .
29 they winter on the pacific and gulf of mexico coasts from central california and florida south to panama , and along the mississippi river at least as far north as st .
30  louis , missouri .
31  in winter quarters , they are rarely found on the open seashore , preferring estuaries and lakes .
32  they cross deserts and mountains but avoid the open ocean on migration .
33  but stray birds , often blown off course by hurricanes , have been seen in the caribbean .
34  in colombian territory it has been recorded first on february 22, 1997, on the san andrs island , where they might have been swept by hurricane marco which passed nearby in november 1996. since then , there have also been a few observations likely to pertain to this species on the south american mainland , e .

36  at calamar .
37 wild american white pelicans may live for more than 16 years .
38  in captivity , the record lifespan stands at over 34 years .
39 ===food and feeding===unlike the brown pelican (p .
40  occidentalis), the american white pelican does not dive for its food .
41  instead it catches its prey while swimming .
42  each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day ,{citation needed|date=december 2008} mostly fish such as cypriniformes like common carp (cyprinus carpio), lahontan tui chub (gila bicolor obesa) and shiners ,{citation needed|date=december 2008} perciformes like sacramento perch (archoplites interruptus) or yellow perch (perca flavescens),{citation needed|date=december 2008} salmoniformes like rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), siluriformes (catfish),{citation needed|date=december 2008} and jackfish{verify source|date=december 2008} .
43  other animals eaten by these birds are crayfish and amphibians , and sometimes larval salamanders .
44  birds nesting on saline lakes , where food is scarce , will travel great distances to better feeding grounds .
45 american white pelicans like to come together in groups of a dozen or more birds to feed , as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another .
46  when this is not easily possible  for example in deep water , where fish can escape by diving out of reach , they prefer to forage alone .
47  but the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds , a practice known as kleptoparasitism .
48  white pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans , gulls and cormorants from the surface of the water and , in one case , from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight .
49 ===reproduction===as noted above , they are colonial breeders , with up to 5,000 pairs per site .
50  the birds arrive on the breeding grounds in march or april; nesting starts between early april and early june .
51  during the breeding season , both males and females develop a pronounced bump on the top of their large beaks .
52  this conspicuous growth is shed by the end of the breeding season .
53 the nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground , in some twigs , sticks , reeds or similar debris have been gathered .
54  after about one week of courtship and nest-building , the female lays a clutch of usually 2 or 3 eggs , sometimes just 1, sometimes up to 6.both parents incubate for about to one month .
55  the young leave the nest 34 weeks after hatching; at this point , usually only one young per nest has survived .
56  they spend the following month in a creche or "pod", moulting into immature plumage and eventually learning to fly .
57  after fledging , the parents care for their offspring some three more weeks , until the close family bond separates in late summer or early fall , and the birds gather in larger groups on rich feeding grounds in preparation for the migration to the winter quarters .
58  they migrate south by september or october .
59 ===predation===occasionally , these pelicans may nest in colonies on isolated islands , which is believed to significantly reduce the likelihood of mammalian predation .
60  red foxes and coyotes readily predate colonies that they can access , the later being the only known species to hunt adult pelicans (which are too large for most bird predators to subdue) .
61  several gulls have been known to predate pelican eggs and nestlings (including herring , ring-billed and california gull), as well as common ravens .
62  young pelicans may be hunted by great horned owls , red-tailed hawks , bald eagles , and golden eagles .
63  the pelicans react to mammalian threats differently from avian threats .
64  though fairly approachable while feeding , the pelicans may temporarily abandon their nests if a human or other large mammal closely approaches the colony .
65  if the threat is another bird , however , the pelicans do not abandon the nest and may fight off the interloper by jabbing at them with their considerable bills .
66 ===status and conservation===this species is protected by the migratory bird treaty act of 1918. it has the california department of fish and game protective status california species of special concern (csc) .
67  on a global scale however , the species is common enough to qualify as a species of least concern according to the iucn .
68 habitat loss is the largest known cause of nesting failure , with flooding and drought being recurrent problems .
69  human-related losses include entanglement in fishing gear , boating disturbance and poaching as well as additional habitat degradation .
70 there was a pronounced decline in american white pelican numbers in the mid-20th century , attributable to the excessive spraying of ddt , endrin and other organochlorides in agriculture as well as widespread draining and pollution of wetlands .
71  but populations have recovered well after stricter environmental protection laws came into effect , and are stable or slightly increasing today .
72  by the 1980s , more than 100,000 adult american white pelicans were estimated to exist in the wild , with 33,000 nests altogether in the 50 colonies in canada , and 18,500 nests in the 1417 united states colonies .
73  shoreline erosion at breeding colonies remains a problem in some cases , as are the occasional mass poisonings when pesticides are used near breeding or wintering sites .
