0 the american white ibis (eudocimus albus) is a species of bird in the ibis family , threskiornithidae .
1  it is found from north carolina via the gulf coast of the united states south through most of the coastal new world tropics .
2 [2] this particular ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage , bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs , and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight .
3  males are larger and have longer bills than females .
4  the breeding range runs along the gulf and atlantic coast , and the coasts of mexico and central america .
5  outside the breeding period , the range extends further inland in north america and also includes the caribbean .
6  it is also found along the northwestern south american coastline in colombia and venezuela .
7  populations in central venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis .
8  the two have been classified by some authorities as a single species .
9 their diet consists primarily of small aquatic prey , such as insects and small fishes .
10  crayfish are its preferred food in most regions , but it can adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance .
11  its main foraging behavior is probing with its beak at the bottom of shallow water to feel for and capture its prey .
12  it does not see the prey .
13 during the breeding season , the american white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water .
14  pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents care for the young , although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success .
15  males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during the breeding season .
16 human pollution has affected the behavior of the american white ibis via an increase in the concentrations of methylmercury , which is released into the environment from untreated waste .
17  exposure to methylmercury alters the hormone levels of american white ibis , affecting their mating and nesting behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates .
18 taxonomythe american white ibis was one of the many bird species originally described by carl linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his systema naturae , where it was given the binomial name of scolopax albus .
19 [3] the species name is the latin adjective albus "white" .
20 [4] alternative common names that have been used include spanish curlew and white curlew .
21 [5] english naturalist mark catesby mistook immature birds for a separate species , which he called the brown curlew .
22 [6] local creole names in louisiana include bec croche and petit flaman .
23 [7]johann georg wagler gave the species its current binomial name in 1832 when he erected the new genus eudocimus , whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (e .
24  ruber) .
25  there has long been debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species ,[8] and the american ornithologists' union considers the two to be a superspecies as they are parapatric .
26 [9] the lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in the view that the species were separate .
27 [8]however , in a field study published in 1987, researchers cristina ramo and benjamin busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the llanos region of colombia and venezuela .
28  they observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing , as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage , or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species ,[9] has been followed by least one field guide .
29 [5] hybrid ibises have also been recorded in florida , where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of american white ibis .
30  birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations .
31 [8]ornithologists james hancock and jim kushlan also consider the two to be a single species , with the differences in plumage , size , skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters .
32  they have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern south america after a period of separation , and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet .
33  they have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of south america are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon , and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this .
34 [8]descriptionthe white plumage and pink facial skin of adult american white ibises are distinctive .
35 [10] adults have black wingtips that are usually only visible in flight .
36 [11] in non-breeding condition the long downcurved bill and long legs are bright red-orange .
37 [12] during the first ten days of the breeding season , the skin darkens to a deep pink on the bill and an almost purple-tinted red on the legs .
38  it then fades to a paler pink , and the tip of the bill becomes blackish .
39 [13] it is difficult to determine the sex of an adult american white ibis from its external appearance , since the sexes have similar plumage .
40 [14] however , there is sexual dimorphism in size and proportion as males are significantly larger and heavier than females and have longer and stouter bills .
41 [15] a study of the american white ibis in southern florida yielded weight ranges of 872.9 to 1,261 g (1.924 to 2.780 lb) for males and 592.7 to 861.3 g (1.307 to 1.899 lb) for females , with average weights of 1,036.4 g (2.285 lb) for males and 764.5 g (1.685 lb) for females .
42 [15][16] the length of adult female and male birds ranges from 53 to 70 cm (21 to 28 in) with a 90 to 105 cm (35 to 41 in) wingspan .
43 [17][18] among standard measurements , american white ibis measure 20.531 cm (8.112.2 in) along each wing , have a tail measurement of 9.312.2 cm (3.74.8 in), a tarsus of 6.7511.3 cm (2.664.45 in) and a culmen of 1116.9 cm (4.36.7 in) .
44 [8]the newly hatched american white ibis is covered with purple down feathers , deepening to dark brown or black on the head and wings .
45  the chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head .
46  the irises are brown .
47  the exposed skin is pinkish initially , apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray , but turns gray within a few days of hatching .
48 [8] the bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine ,[19] and develops three black rings from around day six , before turning gray by around six weeks of age .
49  the gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six , and face and bill become pink a few weeks later , while the legs remain gray .
50  the irises have turned slate-gray by this stage .
51 [8] once fledged , the juvenile american white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump , underwing and underparts are white .
52 [11] the legs become light orange .
53  as it matures , white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage .
54 [11] this is mostly complete by the end of the second year , although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year .
55  juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight .
56 [8]like other species of ibis , the american white ibis flies with neck and legs outstretched , often in long loose lines or v formationsa 1986 field study in north carolina noted over 80% of adult ibis doing so , while juveniles rapidly took up the practice over the course of the summer .
57  the resulting improvement in aerodynamics may lower energy expenditure .
58 [20] these lines fly in an undulating pattern as they alternately flap and glide .
59  soaring in a circular pattern is also seen .
60 [21] heights of 500 to 1,000 m (1,600 to 3,300 ft) may be reached as birds glide over flights of 20 km (12 mi) or more .
61  more commonly , birds fly between 60 and 100 m (200 and 330 ft) above the ground , gliding or flapping at a rate of around 3.3 wingbeats a second .
62 [22]the main call of the american white ibis is a honking sound , transcribed as urnk , urnk ,[23] or hunk , hunk .
63 [8] the call is used in flight , courtship or when disturbed .
64  birds also utter a muted huu-huu-huu call while foraging , and make a squealing call in courtship .
65  young in the nest give a high-pitched zziu as a begging call .
66 [8]similar speciesimmature american white and scarlet ibises are very difficult to tell apart , although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face .
67 [24] an immature american white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis , but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump .
68  the adult is distinguishable from the wood stork , which is much larger and its wings have more black on them .
69 [21]distribution and habitatthe american white ibis is most common in florida , where over 30,000 have been counted in a single breeding colony .
70  it also occurs throughout the caribbean , on both coasts of mexico (from baja california southwards) and central america , and as far south as columbia and venezuela .
71  the non-breeding range extends further inland , reaching north to virginia , and west to eastern texas .
72 adult american white ibis on pavement outside of orlando , fl .
73 the species is known to wander , and has been sighted , sometimes in small flocks , in states far out of its usual range .
74 [5][11]in north america , breeding takes place along the atlantic coast , from the carolinas south to florida and thence west along the gulf coast .
75 [2] laguna cuyutln is an isolated and regionally important wetland in the state of colima on mxico's west coast where a breeding colony has been recorded .
76 [25] american white ibises are not faithful to the sites where they breed ,[26] and large breeding colonies composed of ten thousand birds or more can congregate and disband in one or two breeding seasons .
77 [27] breeding populations across its range have fluctuated greatly with wholesale movement between states .
78 [28] until the 1940s , the species only bred in large numbers in florida , mostly within the everglades .
79 [27] drought conditions elsewhere in the united states led to over 400,000 american white ibis breeding there in the 1930s .
80 [28] in the 1950s and 1960s , large colonies appeared in alabama , louisiana , and then north and south carolina and the gulf coast of florida , and finally texas in the 1970s .
81  then , between the 1970s and early 1990s , breeding colonies declined and disappeared in south carolina and florida , and greatly increased in louisiana ,[27] and north carolina .
82 [28] colonies last between one and seventeen years , their longevity related to size and quality of nearby wetlands .
83  the longest-lasting are associated with wetlands over 800 km2 (310 sq mi) in size .
84  degradation of wetland or breeding sites are reasons for abandonment .
85 [27] the population of american white ibises in a colony at pumpkinseed island in georgetown county , south carolina dropped from 10,000 to zero between 1989 and 1990 as hurricane hugo had inundated nearby freshwater foraging areas with salt water .
86 [29]the american white ibis is found in a variety of habitats , although shallow coastal marshes , wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred .
87 [30] it is also commonly found in muddy pools , on mudflats and even wet lawns .
88  populations that are away from the coast and shoreline , particularly in southern florida , often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes , ponds and flooded fields .
89 [2][11] in summer , these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively .
90 [30]fossil recordremains similar to the american white ibis have been found in middle pliocene deposits of the bone valley formation in central florida , and lower pliocene deposits of the yorktown formation at lee creek in north carolina .
91 [31] two species , one living and one extinct , have been recovered from the talara tar seeps in northern coastal peru .
92  eudocimus peruvianus was described from a tarsometatarsus that differed slightly from e .
93  albus , whose remains were also found there .
94  remains of neither species are common in the beds .
95  the tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old .
96  the american white ibis is still found in peru .
97 [32]behaviora field study late in the florida nesting season revealed that on an average day , adult american white ibis spent 10.25 hours looking for food , 0.75 hours flying , 13 hours resting , roosting , and attending to their nests .
98 [33] much of the time roosting is spent preening , biting and working their feathers with their long bills , as well as rubbing the oil glands on the sides of their heads on back plumage .
99  american white ibis generally only preen themselves , not engaging in allopreening unless part of courtship behavior .
100  bathing often takes place before preening; ibis squat in water 520 cm (2.07.9 in) deep and flick water over themselves with each wing in succession .
101  hundreds of birds may bathe together around the time of courtship .
102 [22]the american white ibis is territorial , defending the nesting and display sites against intruders .
103  agonistic or threat displays include lunging forward with the bill in a horizontal posture , and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display .
104  birds also lunge and bite , often holding onto an opponent's head or wings .
105 [22]breeding and lifespanthe american white ibis pairs up in spring and breeds in huge colonies , often with other waterbird species .
106  nesting begins as soon as suitable foraging and nesting habitat is available .
107  the female selects the site , usually in the branches of a tree or shrub , which is often over water , and builds the nest , and males assist by bringing nest material .
108 [12] anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid , with two or three being the most common .
109  the eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure 5.8 cm  3.9 cm (2.3 in  1.5 in) and weigh on average 50.8 g (1.79 oz) .
110 [5] clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies , although there are no statistically significant differences in the fledging rate of both colonies .
111 [33] throughout the mating and incubation period , the male undergoes a period of starvation to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food .
112 [34] in the 2006 breeding season , a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other american white ibisesthe first time the behavior has been documented for this species .
113 [35]although the american white ibis is predominantly monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young , the male often flies off to engage in extra pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner .
114  these extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations ,[36] and make up about 45% of all total matings , although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful .
115 [36] by not restricting the number of females it copulates with , the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably .
116  although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations , male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males .
117 [34]the breeding success of the american white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels .
118  low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility .
119  water level reversals , where levels rise in the breeding season , disperse prey and impact on foraging success .
120  nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability .
121 [37] the success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests , and varies greatly between nearby colonies .
122 [28] american white ibis parents have been known to supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years , when fish and crayfish are more scarce .
123 [38] studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers .
124  this is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted .
125 [39] this highlights the fact that american white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead , rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates .
126 [40] the draining of wetlands in south florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the american white ibis , and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the everglades .
127 [41]the main cause of nest failure among the species is due to nest abandonment ,[39] the leading cause of which is inundation from extremely high tides .
128  parents abandoned 61% of all nesting starts either during or immediately after extremely high tides .
129  the eggs float out of the flooded nests , or get washed out into the sea by wave action .
130  incubating parents usually abandon the nest when the water or tidal levels reaches 3 to 8 cm (1.2 to 3.1 in) above the bottom of the nest cup .
131  nevertheless , there have been instances where the parents have been observed to transport their eggs to another nest in an attempt to salvage some eggs .
132  however , despite the fact that some nesting sites face high chance of tidal damage every breeding season , american white ibises still continue to nest in these areas because of other favorable conditions such as abundant nearby food sources and low egg predation rates .
133 [40]juvenile in floridathe eggs hatch after about three weeks and the young are attended by both parents .
134  males are present around the nest for most of the day , and females most of the night .
135  the parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening .
136  most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties .
137  little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6 a .
138 m .
139 [42] chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching , with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the everglades .
140 [28] during periods of food limitations and starvation events , the american white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality .
141 [43] for many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings , mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings as a result of the parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs .
142 [44] however , in the case of the american white ibis , the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts .
143 [43] although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions , it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival , or , being generally larger , the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food .
144 [44]bird predators may seize anywhere from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony .
145 [22] the fish crow (corvus ossifragus) is common raider of american white ibis nests , accounting for up to 44% of egg loss in a field study at battery island , north carolina .
146 [45] other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (nycticorax nycticorax), gulls , and possibly vultures , as well as the common opossum (didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (procyon lotor), and rat snakes (elaphe species) .
147 [22] egg predation rates of the american white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents , especially during the last week of incubation .
148  high nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times , as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation .
149 [45]the american white ibis begins breeding in its third summer , although birds in captivity may breed as young as nine or ten months of age .
150 [28] the oldest member of the species recorded in captivity was over 20 years of age , and a wild bird has been picked up 16 years and 4 months after being banded .
151 [5]adult eating a fishthe american white ibis prefers to eat crayfish and other crustaceans , but also takes aquatic insects and small fishes .
152 [12][46] outside the nesting season , the diet is highly variable , as abundance and types of prey depend on the both region and habitat .
153  in los llanos , located on the border of columbia and venezuela , the most frequent prey are insects , such as fly larvae and beetles .
154  generally in north america the main prey are crustaceans , mostly crayfish .
155 [47] in the everglades and cypress swamps , the diet is primarily made up of crayfish , while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish .
156  american white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs .
157 [30] the tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill .
158  in the everglades , this means that crayfish make up a large part of the diet , but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas .
159 [48] although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises , prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance .
160  it is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded , or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfishnormally , fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily .
161  fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the american white ibis .
162 [30] in the breeding season , american white ibises in a colony at pumpkinseed island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish , than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated , indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young .
163 [49] this travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at pumpkinseed island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes .
164 [50]the american white ibis is found in mixed-species foraging flocks with the glossy ibis (plegadis falcinellus) in flooded fields , and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain .
165 [5] the wood stork is also found in the same habitat in florida , but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish , so there is little overlap .
166 [48] in the llanos , where american white ibis coexist with the scarlet ibis , their diets differ , the former consuming more bugs , fish and crustaceans , while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles .
167 [47] the willet (tringa semipalmata) has been observed trailing american white ibis and catching prey disturbed by them , and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them , in j .
168  n .
169  "ding" darling national wildlife refuge on sanibel island in florida .
170 [51] an isolated event of intraspecific predation in juvenile american white ibis has been observed , where a juvenile attacked and consumed a chick from another nest .
171 [52]foragingduring the summer , the american white ibis roams along the coast of tidal flats and mangrove swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded .
172  however , as the water level recedes in the fall , populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland , to inland marshes and swamplands .
173 [30] it has become more common in urban landscapes in florida since the late 1990s ,[53] and is one of a number of wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state .
174 [54]the american white ibis is a tactile , nonvisual forager , which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey .
175 [55] for the most part , the american white ibis forages for food by tactile probing .
176  it wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long , downcurved bill into the substrate of the water body with its bill held at around 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) agape at the tip , and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items .
177 [2] birds may also probe when standing still .
178  groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone , as is head swinging , in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water .
179  others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it .
180  on land , the american white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks , and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate .
181 [55] the american white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around , as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat , and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch .
182 [30][56] along with the scarlet ibis , the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the llanos in venezuela .
183  american white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises , but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior .
184 [57]adults foraging for food in a front garden in floridajuveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks , the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults .
185  they usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group .
186 [58] during the breeding season , adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony .
187  the raiders force their bill down the throat of the victimeither the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed youngand extract the ball of food .
188 [59] this behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest , and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis , which would reduce its own reproductive success .
189  females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males , but instead try to avoid or move away from them .
190 [59] this pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate .
191 [59] the explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear , because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and , as males are larger , they need more food than females .
192 [60]parasites and mortalitycauses of death of adult ibis are not well known .
193  alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises but there has been little research in the area .
194 [28] a flock of fifty adult american white ibis were killed in a fire in the everglades .
195  the corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there .
196  it is unclear why they had not been able to fly away from the fire , but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire .
197 [61]a total of 51 species of parasitic worm have been recovered from the american white ibis , predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine .
198  these include cestoda (tapeworms), acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), nematoda (roundworms), digenea and spirurida .
199  several roundworm and spirurid species have been found in the lining of the gizzard .
200 [62] nematodes are more prevalent in american white ibis from freshwater habitats , and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas .
201  one nematode found in adult birds , skrjabinoclavia thapari , is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host , while the thorny headed worm species southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis .
202 [28]parasitic protozoa of the genus sarcocystis have been recovered from the smooth muscles of adult american white ibis ,[63] and another species , haemoproteus plataleae , has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings , and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest .
203 [64][65] the larvae of two species of mite of the family hypoderidae , phalacrodectes whartoni and neoattialges eudocimae , have been recovered from under the skin .
204 [66] two species of the louse suborder mallophaga , plegadiphilus eudocimus and ardeicola robusta , also parasitise the bird .
205 [64]statusthe american white ibis is classed as being of least concern on the iucn red list .
206 [1] the population consists of 150,000 mature adults , and is stable , although some populations have unknown trends .
207  a partial survey of under 50% of the north american population published in 2007 found an almost six-fold increase in the last four decades .
208  the estimated breeding range is huge , at 1,200,000 km2 (460,000 sq mi) .
209 [67] fluctuating breeding populations and high mobility of colonies make estimating the population difficult .
210  attempted censuses of breeding colonies across texas , louisiana , florida , and the carolinas yielded a count of 166,000 breeding birds in 2001, and 209,000 in 2004.[28] the conservation status has been listed in two statesit is a species of special concern in florida , and a species of moderate conservation concern in alabama .
211  the preservation of colony sites and freshwater foraging areas is important to maintaining populations; however , the highly mobile nature of breeding colonies makes this challenging .
212 [28]human impactjohn james audubon reported that the american white ibis was hunted and sold in louisiana , and mainly eaten by american indians .
213  it had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste .
214 [7] elsewhere , the flesh has been described as appealing on account of the crayfish diet , and both members of the genus eudocimus have been hunted , which has been responsible for decline , across their range .
215 [8] crawfish farmers in louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds .
216  overall , the impact of hunting is not thought to be major .
217 [28]the pollutant methylmercury is a globally distributed neurotoxin and an endocrine system disruptor .
218  in the everglades ecosystem , human pollution has led to increased concentrations of methylmercury , which have impacted the behaviors of the american white ibis .
219 [68] hormone levels in males are affected , leading to a decrease in the rates of key courtship behavior , and fewer approaches by females during the mating season .
220 [69] in addition , methylmercury also increased male-male pairing behaviors by 55% .
221  both the chemically induced "homosexual" behavior and the diminished ability to attract females by males have reduced reproduction rates in affected populations .
222 [69] exposure of american white ibises to methylmercury causes reduced foraging efficiency[70] and it also makes them more likely to abandon nests owing to the disruptive effect of the pollutant on the bird's hormone systems , which in turn affects parental care behavior .
223 [68] tests on captive birds have not shown a decreased survival of american white ibis exposed to methylmercury .
224 [71]in culturenative american folklore held that the bird was the last to seek shelter before a hurricane , and the first to emerge afterwards .
225  the bird was thus a symbol for danger and optimism .
226 [72]the university of miami adopted the american white ibis as its official athletics mascot in 1926,[73] and the yearbook was known as the ibis from that year .
227 [72] the mascot was initially known as ibis before adopting the name sebastian in 1957. it was named after san sebastian hall , a residence hall on campus , which sponsored an ibis entry in the college's homecoming celebration .
