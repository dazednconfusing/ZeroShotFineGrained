0 the glossy ibis (plegadis falcinellus) is a wading bird in the ibis family threskiornithidae .
1 ==distribution==this is the most widespread ibis species , breeding in scattered sites in warm regions of europe , asia , africa , australia , and the atlantic and caribbean regions of the americas .
2  it is thought to have originated in the old world and spread naturally from africa to northern south america in the 19th century , from where it spread to north america .
3  the glossy ibis was first found in the new world in 1817 (new jersey) .
4  audubon saw the species just once in floriday in 1832. it expanded its range substantially northwards in the 1940s and to the west in the 1980s .
5  this species is migratory; most european birds winter in africa , and in north america birds from north of the carolinas winter farther south .
6  birds from other populations may disperse widely outside the breeding season .
7  while generally declining in europe , it has recently established a breeding colony in southern spain , and there appears to be a growing trend for the spanish birds to winter in britain and ireland , with at least 22 sightings in 2010. in 2014, a pair attempted to breed in lincolnshire , the first such attempt in britain ==behaviour==glossy ibises undertake dispersal movements after breeding and are very nomadic .
8  the more northerly populations are fully migratory and travel on a broad front , for example across the sahara desert .
9  populations in temperate regions breed during the local spring , while tropical populations nest to coincide with the rainy season .
10  nesting is often in mixed-species colonies .
11  when not nesting , flocks of over 100 individuals may occur on migration , and during the winter or dry seasons the species is usually found foraging in small flocks .
12  glossy ibises often roost communally at night in large flocks , with other species , occasionally in trees which can be some distance from wetland feeding areas .
13 ==habitat==glossy ibises feed in very shallow water and nest in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation such as reeds , papyrus or rushes) and low trees or bushes .
14  they show a preference for marshes at the margins of lakes and rivers but can also be found at lagoons , flood-plains , wet meadows , swamps , reservoirs , sewage ponds , paddies and irrigated farmland .
15  it is less commonly found in coastal locations such as estuaries , deltas , salt marshes and coastal lagoons .
16  preferred roosting sites are normally in large trees which may be distant from the feeding areas .
17 the nests are usually a platform of twigs and vegetation positioned at least {convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on} above water , sometimes up to {convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on} in tall , dense stands of emergent vegetation , low trees or bushes .
18 ==diet==the diet of the glossy ibis is variable according to the season and is very dependent on what is available .
19  prey includes adult and larval insects such as aquatic beetles , dragonflies , damselflies , grasshoppers , crickets , flies and caddisflies , annelida including leeches , molluscs (e .
20 g .
21  snails and mussels), crustaceans (e .
22 g .
23  crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish , amphibians , lizards , small snakes and nestling birds .
24 ==description==this species is a mid-sized ibis .
25  it is {convert|48||66|cm|in|abbr=on} long , averaging around {convert|59.4|cm|in|abbr=on} with an {convert|80||105|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
26  the culmen measures {convert|9.7|to|14.4|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , each wing measures {convert|24.8|-|30.6|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|9|-|11.2|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus measures {convert|6.8|-|11.3|cm|in|abbr=on} .
27  the body mass of this ibis can range from {convert|485|to|970|g|lb|abbr=on} .
28  breeding adults have reddish-brown bodies and shiny bottle-green wings .
29  non-breeders and juveniles have duller bodies .
30  this species has a brownish bill , dark facial skin bordered above and below in blue-gray (non-breeding) to cobalt blue (breeding), and red-brown legs .
31  unlike herons , ibises fly with necks outstretched , their flight being graceful and often in v formation .
32  it also has shiny feathers .
33 sounds made by this rather quiet ibis include a variety of croaks and grunts , including a hoarse grrrr made when breeding .
34 ==conservation==the glossy ibis is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
35  glossy ibises are threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss through drainage , increased salinity , groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants .
36 the common name black curlew may be a reference to the glossy ibis and this name appears in anglo-saxon literature , indicating that it may have bred in early medieval england but yalden and albarella do not mention this species .
