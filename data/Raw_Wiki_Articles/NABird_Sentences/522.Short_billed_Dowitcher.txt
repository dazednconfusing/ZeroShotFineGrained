0 the short-billed dowitcher (limnodromus griseus), like its congener the long-billed dowitcher , is a medium-sized , stocky , long-billed shorebird in the family scolopacidae .
1  it is an inhabitant of north america , central america , and northern south america .
2  it is strongly migratory; it completely vacates in breeding areas during the snow-bound months .
3  this species favors a variety of habitats including tundra in the north to ponds and mudflats in the south .
4  it feeds on invertebrates often by rapidly probing its bill into mud in a sewing machine fashion .
5  it and the very similar long-billed dowitcher were considered one species until 1950. field identification of the two american limnodromus remains difficult today .
6  distinguishing wintering or juvenile short-billed dowitchers from the long-billed species is very difficult and , even given examination their subtlety different body shapes , cannot always be isolated to a particular species .
7  they differ most substantially in vocalizations .
8  the names of american dowitchers are misleading , as there is much overlap in their bill lengths .
9  only a small percentage can be identified by this character alone .
10 ==description==the body of adults is dark brown on top and reddish underneath .
11  the tail has a black and white barred pattern .
12  the legs are a yellowish color .
13  there are three subspecies with slight variations in appearance:none of these combines the reddish belly and barred flanks of the breeding plumage long-billed dowitcher .
14  the winter plumage is largely grey .
15  this bird can range from {convert|23|to|32|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , {convert|46|to|56|cm|in|abbr=on} in wingspan and {convert|73|-|155|g|oz|abbr=on} in body mass .
16 the call of this bird is more mellow than that of the long-billed dowitcher , and is useful in identification , particularly of the difficult adult plumages .
17 ==breeding and habitat==their breeding habitat includes bogs , tidal marshes , mudflats or forest clearings south of the tree line in northern north america .

24  caurinus breeds in southern alaska and southern yukon .
25 these birds nest on the ground , usually near water .
26  their nests are shallow depressions in clumps of grass or moss , which are lined with fine grasses , twigs and leaves .
27  they lay four , sometimes three , olive-buff to brown eggs .
28  incubation lasts for 21 days and is done by both sexes .
29 the downy juvenile birds leave the nest soon after hatching .
30  parental roles are not well known , but it is believed the female departs and leaves the male to tend the chicks , which find all their own food .
31 they migrate to the southern united states and as far south as brazil .
32  this bird is more likely to be seen near ocean coasts during migration than the long-billed dowitcher .
33  this species occurs in western europe only as an extremely rare vagrant .
34 ==feeding==these birds forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud .
35  they mainly eat insects , mollusks , crustaceans and marine worms , but also eat some plant material .
