0 the american herring gull or smithsonian gull (larus smithsonianus or larus argentatus smithsonianus) is a large gull that breeds in north america , where it is treated by the american ornithologists' union as a subspecies of herring gull (l .
1  argentatus) .
2 adults are white with gray back and wings , black wingtips with white spots , and pink legs .
3  immature birds are gray-brown and are darker and more uniform than european herring gulls , with a darker tail .
4 it occurs in a variety of habitats including coasts , lakes , rivers and garbage dumps .
5  its broad diet includes invertebrates , fish , and many other items .
6  it usually nests near water , laying around three eggs in a scrape on the ground .
7 taxonomyit was first described as a new species in 1862 by elliott coues based on a series of specimens from the smithsonian institution .
8  it was later reclassified as a subspecies of the herring gull (larus argentatus) .
9  the taxonomy of the herring gull group is very complicated and much is still controversial and uncertain .
10  a 2002 study suggested that the american herring gull is not closely related to european herring gulls , belonging instead to a separate clade of gulls .
11 [2] several authorities such as the association of european rarities committees and british ornithologists' union now recognize it as a separate species .
12  the bou also includes the east siberian gull (larus vegae) of north-east asia within the american herring gull .
13 [2] the american ornithologists' union has not adopted the split and continues to treat the american herring gull as a subspecies of larus argentatus .

26 first-cycle bird in texasyoung birds take four years to reach fully adult plumage .
27  during this time they go through several plumage stages and can be very variable in appearance .
28  first-winter birds are gray-brown with a dark tail , a brown rump with dark bars , dark outer primaries and pale inner primaries , dark eyes , and a dark bill , which usually develops a paler base through the winter .
29  the head is often paler than the body .

33  the "long call" is a series of notes during which the head is dipped then raised .

35 [6] juvenile birds emit high-pitched plaintive cries to elicit feeding behavior from a parent and may also emit a clicking distress call when a parent suddenly flies off .

41  european birds lack the long gray tongues on the 6th , 7th , and 8th primaries and solid black markings on the 5th and 6th primaries that are shown by american herring gulls .
42 [7] first-winter european birds have more checkered upperparts , more streaked underparts , and a paler rump and base to the tail .
43 [3]distribution and habitatthe breeding range extends across the northern part of north america from central and southern alaska to the great lakes and north-east coast of the usa from maine south to north carolina .
44  it breeds over most of canada apart from the southwest and arctic regions .
45 birds are present all year in southern alaska , the great lakes and north-east usa but most birds winter to the south of the breeding range as far as mexico with small numbers reaching hawaii , central america and the west indies .
46  vagrants have reached colombia and venezuela and there is a report from ecuador and another from peru .
47 [8][9] the first european record was of a bird ringed in new brunswick which was caught on a boat in spanish waters in 1937 and there are have a number of additional records from western europe since 1990.[3] the first british record was in 1994 in cheshire .
48 [10]it usually nests in colonies near water on coasts , islands , and cliffs .
49  it also nests on rooftops in some cities .
50  it feeds at sea and on beaches , mudflats , lakes , rivers , fields , and refuse dumps .
51  it roosts in open areas close to feeding sites .
52 [4]behaviorfeedingherring gull eating a crabherring gull stomping feet to help find preyit has a varied diet including marine invertebrates such as mussels , crabs , sea urchins , and squid; fish such as capelin , alewife , and smelt; insects; and other birds including their chicks and eggs .
53  it often feeds on carrion and human refuse .
54  food is plucked from the surface of the shore or sea or is caught by dipping underwater or by shallow plunge-diving .
55 [4]reproductionpairs form in march or april .
56  the nest is a scrape on the ground lined with vegetation such as grass , seaweed , and feathers .
57 [4][6] usually three eggs are laid over a four- to six-day period .
58  they are 72 mm (2.8 in) long and are variable in color with brown markings on a pale blue , olive or cinnamon background .
59 [11] the eggs are incubated for 3032 days beginning when the second egg is laid .
60  the young birds fledge after 67 weeks and are fed in the nest area for several more weeks .
61  they continue to be cared for by the parents until they are about 6 months old .
62 [4] both parents are involved in building the nest , incubating the eggs and feeding the young .
63 [11] it has been observed that some pairs cement a close bond , staying in watchful proximity of each other year round; other gulls display more independence , but may take the same mate each spring .
64 statusthe species became quite rare during the 19th century when it was hunted for its eggs and feathers .
65  from the 1930s to 1960s , it increased rapidly due to protection from hunting , increased waste from fisheries to feed on , and less competition for small fish and invertebrates as humans reduced the populations of large fish , whales , and pinnipeds (seals) .
66  numbers leveled off during the 1970s and 80s and may now be declining in some areas .
