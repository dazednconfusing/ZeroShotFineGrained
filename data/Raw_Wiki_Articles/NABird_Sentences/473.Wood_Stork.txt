0 the wood stork (mycteria americana) is a large american wading bird in the stork family ciconiidae .
1  it was formerly called the "wood ibis", though it is not an ibis .
2  as of june 26, 2014 it is classified as a threatened species by the u.s.
4  fish & wildlife service .
5 ==description==the adult is a large bird which stands {convert|83|to(-)|115|cm|in|abbr=on} tall and spans {convert|140|to(-)|180|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wings .
6  males typically weigh {convert|2.5|to(-)|3.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}, with a mean weight of {convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}; females weigh {convert|2.0|to(-)|2.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}, with a mean weight of {convert|2.42|kg|lb|abbr=on} .
7  another mean estimated weight for the species was {convert|2.64|kg|lb|abbr=on} .
8  however , exceptionally large males are sometimes found and these can weigh up to {convert|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on} .
9  it appears all white on the ground , with blackish-gray legs and pink feet .
10  in flight , the trailing edge of the wings is black .
11  the head is dark brown with a bald , black face , and the thick down-curved bill is dusky yellow .
12  juvenile birds are a duller version of the adult , generally browner on the neck , and with a paler bill .
13  the bare head and the long bill , which can measure up to {convert|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , render the wood stork distinctive from other large waders in its range .
14  the standard scientific measurements of the wood stork are as follows: the wing is {convert|42|-|49|cm|in|abbr=on}, the culmen is {convert|19|-|25|cm|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|17.5|-|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on} .
15 ==habitat and breeding==this is a subtropical and tropical species which breeds in much of south america , central america and the caribbean .
16  the wood stork is the only stork that presently breeds in north america .
17  in the united states there is a small breeding population in florida , georgia , and south carolina , along with a recently discovered rookery in southeastern north carolina .
18  after a successful three-decade conservation effort resulting in an increased population in the southeastern united states , the wood stork was removed from the endangered species list and upgraded to threatened on june 26, 2014. similarly , in the state of santa catarina , brazil , its decline seems to have been reversed: after an absence between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s , the species is now again regularly encountered there , in particular in the tubaro river region .
19  it is likely that the paran river region's wetlands served as a stronghold of the species , from where it is now re-colonizing some of its former haunts .
20  globally , it is considered a species of least concern by the iucn due to its large range .
21 the wood stork is a broad-winged soaring bird that flies with its neck outstretched and legs extended .
22  it forages usually where lowering water levels concentrate fish in open wetlands; it also frequents paddy fields .
23  walking slowly and steadily in shallow water up to its belly , it seeks prey , which , like that of most of its relatives , consists of fish , frogs and large insects .
24  it catches fish by holding its bill open in the water until a fish is detected .
25 in the united states , the wood stork favors cypress trees in marshes , swamps , or (less often) among mangroves and nearby habitat .
26 a resident breeder in lowland wetlands with trees , the wood stork builds a large stick nest in a forest tree .
27  they nest colonially with up to twenty-five nests in one tree .
28  breeding once a year , a female typically lays three to five eggs in the clutch .
29  the eggs are incubated 2732 days by both sexes .
30  wood storks' reproductive cycle is triggered when waterholes dry up sufficiently to concentrate fish in sufficient numbers for efficient feeding of the chicks .
31  each chick weighs approximately {convert|2|oz|g|abbr=on}, is unable to fly and is helpless .
32  competition for food is fierce , and if food is scarce , only the older chicks will survive .
33  week-old chicks are fed about 15 times per day , and grow rapidly .
34  by 14 days , each will weigh 10 times its hatching weight .
35  at 28 days , each is 25 times heavier .
36  during the breeding season , wood storks need over {convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on} of fish to feed themselves and their offspring .
37  when the weather is very warm , parents also collect water and bring it to the nest to drool on and into the mouths of the chicks .
38  by the time the young are four weeks old , both parents leave the nest to search for food , and this continues until the chicks fledge or leave the nest .
39  young may continue to return to the colony for another 10 to 15 days to roost or to try to get food from their parents .
40  a colony is considered successful if its parents average at least 1.5 fledged young per nest .
41 each adult will defend its nest against various predators .
42  corvids , vultures , grackles and striped skunks will attempt to pick off eggs .
43  raccoons are the leading predator of nests , and can cause almost complete colony nesting failure when water dries under nests in drought years since they can easily access the nest using dry ground under the tree .
44  adults have few natural predators , but unwary ones have been picked off by american alligators .
45 ==evolution==this species seems to have evolved in tropical regions; its north american presence probably postdates the last ice age .
46  a fossil fragment from the touro passo formation found at arroio touro passo (rio grande do sul , brazil) might be of the living species; it is at most from the late pleistocene age , a few 10,000s of years ago .
47  north american fossils from that time are of an extinct larger relative , m .
48  wetmorei .
49  this was probably a sister species; both occurred sympatrically on cuba at the end of the pleistocene .
