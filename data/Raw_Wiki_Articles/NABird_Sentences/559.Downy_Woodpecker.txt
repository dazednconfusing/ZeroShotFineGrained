0 the downy woodpecker (dryobates pubescens) is a species of woodpecker , the smallest in north america .
1 == description ==adult downy woodpeckers are the smallest of north america's woodpeckers but there are many smaller species elsewhere , especially the piculets .
2  the total length of the species ranges from {convert|14|to|18|cm|in|abbr=on} and the wingspan from {convert|25|to|31|cm|in|abbr=on} .
3  body mass ranges from {convert|20|to|33|g|oz|abbr=on} .
4  standard measurements are as follows: the wing chord is {convert|8.5|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|4|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1|-|1.8|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|1.1|-|1.7|cm|in|abbr=on} .
5  the downy woodpecker is mainly black on the upperparts and wings , with a white back , throat and belly and white spotting on the wings .
6  there is a white bar above the eye and one below .
7  they have a black tail with white outer feathers barred with black .
8  adult males have a red patch on the back of the head whereas juvenile birds display a red cap .
9 the downy woodpecker is virtually identical in plumage pattern to the larger hairy woodpecker , but it can be distinguished from the hairy by the presence of black spots on its white tail feathers and the length of its bill .
10  the downy woodpecker's bill is shorter than its head , whereas the hairy woodpecker's bill is approximately equal to head length .
11 the downy woodpecker gives a number of vocalizations , including a short pik call .
12  like other woodpeckers , it also produces a drumming sound with its beak as it pecks into trees .
13  compared to other north american species its drums are slow .
14 == taxonomy ==despite their close resemblance , downy and hairy woodpeckers are not very closely related , and they are likely to be separated in different genera; the outward similarity is a spectacular example of convergent evolution .
15  why they evolved this way cannot be explained with confidence; it may be relevant that the species exploit rather different-sized foodstuffs and do not compete very much ecologically .
16 == ecology and behavior ==downy woodpeckers nest in a tree cavity excavated by the nesting pair in a dead tree or limb .
17  in the winter , they roost in tree cavities .
18  downy woodpeckers forage on trees , picking the bark surface in summer and digging deeper in winter .
19  they mainly eat insects , also seeds and berries .
20  in winter , especially , downy woodpeckers can often be found in suburban backyards with trees and will feed on suet at birdfeeders .
