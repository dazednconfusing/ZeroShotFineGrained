0 the house sparrow (passer domesticus) is a bird of the sparrow family passeridae , found in most parts of the world .
1  a small bird , it has a typical length of 16 centimetres (6.3 inches) and a mass of 2439.5 grams (0.851.39 ounces) .
2  females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey , and males have brighter black , white , and brown markings .
3  one of about 25 species in the genus passer , the house sparrow is native to most of europe , the mediterranean region , and much of asia .
4  its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions , including parts of australia , africa , and the americas , make it the most widely distributed wild bird .
5 the house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitations , and can live in urban or rural settings .
6  though found in widely varied habitats and climates , it typically avoids extensive woodlands , grasslands , and deserts away from human development .
7  it feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds , but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods .
8  its predators include domestic cats , hawks , owls , and many other predatory birds and mammals .
9 because of its numbers , ubiquity and association with human settlements , the house sparrow is culturally prominent .
10  it is extensively , and usually unsuccessfully , persecuted as an agricultural pest , but it has also often been kept as a pet as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust and sexual potency , as well as of commonness and vulgarity .
11  though it is widespread and abundant , its numbers have declined in some areas .
12  the animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the iucn red list .
13 descriptionmeasurements and shapethe house sparrow is typically about 16 cm (6.3 in) long , ranging from 14 to 18 cm (5.5 to 7.1 in) .
14 [3] it is a compact bird with a full chest and a large rounded head .
15  its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of 1.11.5 cm (0.430.59 in), strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds .
16  its tail is short , at 5.26.5 cm (2.02.6 in) long .
17  the wing chord is 6.78.9 cm (2.63.5 in), and the tarsus is 1.62.5 cm (0.630.98 in) .
18 [4][5] in mass , the house sparrow ranges from 24 to 39.5 g (0.85 to 1.39 oz) .
19  females usually are slightly smaller than males .
20  the median mass on the european continent for both sexes is about 30 g (1.1 oz), and in more southerly subspecies is around 26 g (0.92 oz) .
21  younger birds are smaller , males are larger during the winter , and females are larger during the breeding season .
22 [6] birds at higher latitudes , colder climates , and sometimes higher altitudes are larger (under bergmann's rule), both between and within subspecies .
23 [6][7][8][9]plumagethe plumage of the house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown .
24  the sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below , while the male has boldly coloured head markings , a reddish back , and grey underparts .
25 [8] the male has a dark grey crown from the top of its bill to its back , and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head .
26  it has black around its bill , on its throat , and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores) .
27  it has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them .
28  the underparts are pale grey or white , as are the cheeks , ear coverts , and stripes at the base of the head .
29  the upper back and mantle are a warm brown , with broad black streaks , while the lower back , rump and uppertail coverts are greyish-brown .
30 [10]the male is duller in fresh non-breeding plumage , with whitish tips on many feathers .
31  wear and preening expose many of the bright brown and black markings , including most of the black throat and chest patch , called the "bib" or "badge" .
32 [10][11] the badge is variable in width and general size , and some scientists have suggested that patches signal social status or fitness .
33  this hypothesis has led to a "veritable 'cottage industry'" of studies , which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age .
34 [12] the male's bill is black in the breeding season and horn (dark grey) during the rest of the year .
35 [3]the female has no black markings or grey crown .
36  its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium .
37  its underparts are pale grey-brown .
38  the female's bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching the black of the male's bill .
39 [3][10]juveniles are similar to the adult female but deeper brown below and paler above , with paler and less defined supercilia .
40  juveniles have broader buff feather edges , and tend to have looser , scruffier plumage , like moulting adults .
41  juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males , while juvenile female tend to have white throats .
42  however , juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male , and some juvenile females have male features .
43  the bills of young birds are light yellow to straw , paler than the female's bill .
44  immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings , which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage .
45  by their first breeding season , young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults , though they may still be paler during their first year .
46 [3][10]voicefile:one sparrow then another .
47 oggplay mediaa male calling in san franciscomost house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call .
48  transcribed as chirrup , tschilp , or philip , this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds , or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing .
49  in the breeding season the male gives this call repetitively , with emphasis and speed but not much rhythm , forming what is described either as a song or an "ecstatic call" similar to a song .
50 [13][14] young birds also give a true song , especially in captivity , a warbling similar to that of the european greenfinch .
51 [15]aggressive males give a trilled version of their call , transcribed as "chur-chur-r-r-it-it-it-it" .
52  this call is also used by females in the breeding season , to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs .
53 [16] house sparrows give a nasal alarm call , the basic sound of which is transcribed as quer , and a shrill chree call in great distress .
54 [17] another vocalisation is the "appeasement call", a soft quee given to inhibit aggression , usually given between birds of a mated pair .
55 [16] these vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow , but are shared , with small variations , by all sparrows .

58  indicus in kolkata , indiathere is some variation in the twelve subspecies of house sparrow , which are divided into two groups , the oriental indicus group , and the palaearctic domesticus group .
59  birds of the domesticus group have grey cheeks , while indicus group birds have white cheeks as well as bright colouration on the crown , a smaller bill , and a longer black bib .
60 [19] the subspecies passer domesticus tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies , except in the worn breeding plumage of the male , in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler .

85 [20][22][23]identificationthe house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed-eating birds , especially its relatives in the genus passer .
86  many of these relatives are smaller , with an appearance that is neater or "cuter", as with the dead sea sparrow .
87 [24] the dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females , and is nearly identical to the those of the spanish and italian sparrows .
88 [10] the eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek .
89 [25] the male spanish sparrow and italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns .
90  the sind sparrow is very similar but smaller , with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female .
91 [10]taxonomy and systematicsnamesthe house sparrow was among the first animals to be given a scientific name in the modern system of biological classification , since it was described by carl linnaeus , in the 1758 10th edition of systema naturae .
92  it was described from a type specimen collected in sweden , with the name fringilla domestica .
93 [26][27] later the genus name fringilla came to be used only for the common chaffinch and its relatives , and the house sparrow has usually been placed in the genus passer created by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760.[28][29]the bird's scientific name and its usual english name have the same meaning .
94  the latin word passer , like the english word "sparrow", is a term for small active birds , coming from a root word referring to speed .
95 [30][31] the latin word domesticus means "belonging to the house", like the common name a reference to its association with humans .
96 [32] the house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative english names , including english sparrow , chiefly in north america;[33][34] and indian sparrow or indian house sparrow , for the birds of the indian subcontinent and central asia .
97 [35] dialectal names include sparr , sparrer , spadger , spadgick , and philip , mainly in southern england; spug and spuggy , mainly in northern england; spur and sprig , mainly in scotland;[36][37] and spatzie or spotsie , from the german spatz , in north america .
98 [38]taxonomythe genus passer contains about 25 species , depending on the authority , 26 according to the handbook of the birds of the world .
99 [39] most passer species are dull-coloured birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks , between 11 and 18 cm (4.3 and 7.1 in) long .
100 [8][40] mitochondrial dna studies suggest that speciation in the genus occurred during the pleistocene and earlier , while other evidence suggests speciation occurred 25,000 to 15,000 years ago .
101 [41][42] within passer , the house sparrow is part of the "palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows" group and a close relative of the mediterranean "willow sparrows" .
102 [39][43]the taxonomy of the house sparrow and its mediterranean relatives is highly complicated .
103  the common type of "willow sparrow" is the spanish sparrow , which resembles the house sparrow in many respects .
104 [44] it frequently prefers wetter habitats than the house sparrow , and it is often colonial and nomadic .
105 [45] in most of the mediterranean , one or both species occur , with some degree of hybridisation .
106 [46] in north africa , the two species hybridise extensively , forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure spanish sparrows .
107 [47][48][49]in much of italy there is a form apparently intermediate between the house and spanish sparrows , known as the italian sparrow .
108  it resembles a hybrid between the two species , and is in other respects intermediate .
109  its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate .
110 [48][50] in the alps , the italian sparrow intergrades over a roughly 20 km (12 mi) strip with the house sparrow ,[51] but to the south it intergrades over the southern half of italy and some mediterranean islands with the spanish sparrow .
111 [48] on the mediterranean islands of malta , gozo , crete , rhodes , and karpathos , there are other apparently intermediate birds of unknown status .
112 [48][52][53]subspeciesa large number of subspecies have been named , of which twelve were recognised in the handbook of the birds of the world .
113  these subspecies are divided into two groups , the palaearctic domesticus group , and the oriental indicus group .
114 [39] several middle eastern subspecies , including passer domesticus biblicus , are sometimes considered a third , intermediate group .

125  korelov proposed the separation of the indicus group as a separate species .
126 [28][54] however , indicus-group and domesticus-group birds intergrade in a large part of iran , so this split is rarely recognised .
127 [39]in north america , house sparrow populations are more differentiated than those in europe .
128 [7] this variation follows predictable patterns , with birds at higher latitudes being larger and those in arid areas being paler .
129 [8][55][56] however , it is not clear how much this is caused by evolution or by environment .
130 [57][58][59][60] similar observations have been made in new zealand ,[61] and in south africa .
131 [62] the introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status , especially in north america and southern africa ,[39] and american ornithologist harry church oberholser even gave the subspecies name plecticus to the paler birds of western north america .

181 [39] it has also been introduced to mohli in the comoros .
182 [67]distribution and habitatby a nest in a saguaro cactus in arizonathe house sparrow originated in the middle east and spread , along with agriculture , to most of eurasia and parts of north africa .
183 [68] since the mid-nineteenth century , it has reached most of the world , chiefly due to deliberate introductions , but also through natural and shipborne dispersal .
184 [69] its introduced range encompasses most of north america , central america , southern south america , southern africa , part of west africa , australia , new zealand , and islands throughout the world .
185 [70] it has greatly extended its range in northern eurasia since the 1850s ,[71] and continues to do so , as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of iceland and rishiri island , japan .
186 [72] the extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet .
187 [70]introductionsthe house sparrow has become highly successful in most parts of the world where it has been introduced .
188  this is mostly due to its early adaptation to living with humans , and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions .
189 [73][74] other factors may include its robust immune response , compared to the eurasian tree sparrow .
190 [75] where introduced , it can extend its range quickly , sometimes at a rate of over 230 km (140 mi) per year .
191 [76] in many parts of the world it has been characterised as a pest , and poses a threat to native birds .
192 [77][78] a few introductions have died out or been of limited success , such as those to greenland and cape verde .
193 [79]the first of many successful introductions to north america occurred when birds from england were released in new york city , in 1852 [80][81] in order to control the ravages of the linden moth .
194 [82] the house sparrow now occurs from the northwest territories to southern panama ,[4] and it is one of the most abundant birds in north america .
195 [77] the house sparrow was first introduced to australia in 1863 at melbourne and is common throughout the eastern part of the continent ,[79] but has been prevented from establishing itself in western australia , where every house sparrow found in the state is killed .
196 [83] house sparrows were introduced in new zealand in 1859, and from there reached many of the pacific islands , including hawaii .
197 [84]in southern africa birds of both the european subspecies domesticus and the indian subspecies indicus were introduced around 1900. birds of domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns , while indicus birds have spread rapidly , reaching tanzania in the 1980s .
198  despite this success , native relatives such as the cape sparrow also occur in towns , competing successfully with it .
199 [79][85] in south america , it was first introduced near buenos aires around 1870, and quickly became common in most of the southern part of the continent .
200  it now occurs almost continuously from tierra del fuego to the fringes of amazonia , with isolated populations as far north as coastal venezuela .
201 [79][86][87]habitatthe house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and cultivation .
202 [88] it is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested: central asian house sparrows usually breed away from humans in open country ,[89] and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans .
203 [88][90][91] the only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra .
204  well adapted to living around humans , it frequently lives and even breeds indoors , especially in factories , warehouses and zoos .
205 [88] it has been recorded breeding in an english coal mine 640 m (2,100 ft) below ground ,[92] and feeding on the empire state building's observation deck at night .
206 [93] it reaches its greatest densities in urban centres , but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs , where insects are more abundant .
207 [88][94] on a larger scale , it is most abundant in wheat-growing areas such as the midwestern united states .
208 [95]it tolerates a variety of climates , but prefers drier conditions , especially in moist tropical climates .
209 [79][88] it has several adaptations to dry areas , including a high salt tolerance[96] and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries .
210 [97] in most of eastern asia the house sparrow is entirely absent , replaced by the eurasian tree sparrow .
211 [98] where these two species overlap , the house sparrow is usually more common than the eurasian tree sparrow , but one species may replace the other in a manner that ornithologist maud doria haviland described as "random , or even capricious" .
212 [99] in most of its range the house sparrow is extremely common , despite some declines ,[100] but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges , its distribution can be spotty .
213 [88]behavioursocial behaviourthe house sparrow is a very social bird .
214  it is gregarious at all seasons when feeding , often forming flocks with other types of bird .
215 [101] it roosts communally , its nests are usually grouped together in clumps , and it engages in social activities such as dust or water bathing and "social singing", in which birds call together in bushes .
216 [102][103] the house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground , but it flocks in trees and bushes .
217 [102] at feeding stations and nests , female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size , and in the reproductive period (usually spring or summer), being dominant , they can fight for males .
218 [104][105]sleep and roostinghouse sparrows sleep with the bill tucked underneath the scapular feathers .
219 [106] outside of the reproductive season , they often roost communally in trees or shrubs .
220  there is much communal chirping before and after the birds settle in the roost in the evening , as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning .
221 [102] some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night .
222 [107]body maintenancedust or water bathing is common and often occurs in groups .
223  anting is rare .
224 [108] head scratching is done with the leg over the drooped wing .
225 [107]feedingfile:passer domesticus female - foraging plants .
226 oggplay mediafemale foraging in germanyas an adult , the house sparrow mostly feeds on the seeds of grains and weeds , but it is opportunistic and adaptable , and eats whatever foods are available .
227 [109] in towns and cities it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs .
228  it can perform complex tasks to obtain food , such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets ,[110] clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies ,[111] and nectar robbing kowhai flowers .
229 [112] in common with many other birds , the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet .
230  grit can be either stone , often grains of masonry , or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred .
231 [113][114]several studies of the house sparrow in temperate agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90% .
232 [109][115][116] it will eat almost any seeds , but where it has a choice , it prefers oats and wheat .
233 [117] in urban areas , the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans , such as bread , though it prefers raw seeds .
234 [116][118] the house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds , including buds , berries , and fruits such as grapes and cherries .
235 [97][116] in temperate areas , the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers , especially yellow ones , in the spring .
236 [119]animals form another important part of the house sparrow's diet , chiefly insects , of which beetles , caterpillars , dipteran flies , and aphids are especially important .
237  various non-insect arthropods are eaten , as are molluscs and crustaceans where available , earthworms , and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs .
238 [109] young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about fifteen days after hatching .
239 [120] they are also given small quantities of seeds , spiders , and grit .
240  in most places , grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings .
241 [121] true bugs , ants , sawflies , and beetles are also important , but house sparrows will take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young .
242 [121][122][123] house sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds , including american robins .
243 [4]locomotionthe house sparrow's flight is direct (not undulating) and flapping , averaging 45.5 kilometres per hour (28.3 miles per hour) and about 15 wingbeats per second .
244 [107][124] on the ground , the house sparrow typically hops rather than walks .
245  it can swim when pressed to do so , by pursuit from predators .
246  captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances underwater .
247 [107]dispersal and migrationmost house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetime .
248  however , there is limited migration in all regions .
249  some young birds disperse long distances , especially on coasts , and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter .
250 [102][125][126] two subspecies , bactrianus and parkini , are predominantly migratory .
251  unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate , birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight .
252 [102]breedinghouse sparrows can breed in the breeding season immediately following their hatching , and sometimes attempt to do so .
253  some birds breeding for the first time in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage .
254 [127] birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young , and reproductive success increases with age , as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season , and fledge more young .
255 [128] as the breeding season approaches , hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites .
256 [129][130] the timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically , and between specific locations and years .
257  this is because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings .
258 [131]males take up nesting sites before the breeding season , by frequently calling beside them .
259  unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females .
260  when a female approaches a male during this period , the male displays by moving up and down while drooping and shivering his wings , pushing up his head , raising and spreading his tail , and showing his bib .
261 [131] males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying .
262  in response , a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away , pursued by the male .
263  the male displays in front of her , attracting other males , who also pursue and display to the female .
264  this group display usually does not immediately result in copulations .
265 [131] other males usually do not copulate with the female .
266 [132][133] copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male .
267  birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs , and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates .
268 [131]the house sparrow is monogamous , and typically mates for life .
269  birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations , so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate .
270 [134] male house sparrows guard their mates carefully to avoid being cuckolded , and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites .
271 [132][135] males may sometimes have multiple mates , and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females .
272 [136] many birds do not find a nest and a mate , and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs , a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate .
273  lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season .
274 [132][137] the formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds is tied to the holding of a nest site , though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest .
275 [131]nestingnest sites are varied , though cavities are preferred .
276  nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses .
277  holes in cliffs and banks , or tree hollows , are also used .
278 [138][139] a sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches , but more frequently uses the nests of other birds such as those of swallows in banks and cliffs , and old tree cavity nests .
279 [138] it usually uses deserted nests , though sometimes it usurps active ones .
280 [138][140] tree hollows are more commonly used in north america than in europe ,[138] putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other north american cavity nesters , and thereby contributing to their population declines .
281 [77]especially in warmer areas , the house sparrow may build its nests in the open , on the branches of trees , especially evergreens and hawthorns , or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies .
282 [131][138][141] in open nesting sites , breeding success tends to be lower , since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms .
283 [138][142] less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs , favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds , which are then domed over .
284 [138][139]the nest is usually domed , though it may lack a roof in enclosed sites .
285 [138] it has an outer layer of stems and roots , a middle layer of dead grass and leaves , and a lining of feathers , as well as of paper and other soft materials .
286 [139] nests typically have external dimensions of 20  30 cm (8  12 in),[131] but their size varies greatly .
287 [139] the building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females .
288  the female assists in building , but is less active than the male .
289 [138] some nest building occurs throughout the year , especially after moult in autumn .
290  in colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests , or roost in street lights , to avoid losing heat during the winter .
291 [138][143] house sparrows do not hold territories , but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex .
292 [138]house sparrows' nests support a wide range of scavenging insects , including nest flies such as neottiophilum praestum , protocalliphora blowflies ,[144][145] and over 1,400 species of beetle .
293 [146]eggs and youngeggs in a nestclutches usually comprise four or five eggs , though numbers from one to ten have been recorded .
294  at least two clutches are usually laid , and up to seven a year may be laid in the tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes .
295  when fewer clutches are laid in a year , especially at higher latitudes , the number of eggs per clutch is greater .
296  central asian house sparrows , which migrate and have only one clutch a year , average 6.5 eggs in a clutch .
297  clutch size is also affected by environmental and seasonal conditions , female age , and breeding density .
298 [147][148]naked and blind chicka hatchlingsome intraspecific brood parasitism occurs , and instances of unusually large numbers of eggs in a nest may be the result of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours .
299  such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females .
300 [147][149] the house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites , but only rarely , since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter , and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites .
301 [150][151] in turn , the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the american cliff swallow .
302 [149][152]a juvenile , showing its pink bill and obvious nestling gapethe soft , swollen base , which becomes harder and less swollen as the bird matures .
303 the eggs are white , bluish-white , or greenish-white , spotted with brown or grey .
304 [107] subelliptical in shape ,[8] they range from 20 to 22 mm (0.79 to 0.87 in) in length and 14 to 16 mm (0.55 to 0.63 in) in width ,[4] have an average mass of 2.9 g (0.10 oz),[153] and an average surface area of 9.18 cm2 (1.423 in2) .
305 [154] eggs from the tropical subspecies are distinctly smaller .
306 [155][156] eggs begin to develop with the deposition of yolk in the ovary a few days before ovulation .
307  in the day between ovulation and laying , egg white forms , followed by eggshell .
308 [157] eggs laid later in a clutch are larger , as are those laid by larger females , and egg size is hereditary .
309  eggs decrease slightly in size from laying to hatching .
310 [158] the yolk comprises 25% of the egg , the egg white 68%, and the shell 7% .
311  eggs are watery , being 79% liquid , and otherwise mostly protein .
312 [159]the female develops a brood patch of bare skin and plays the main part in incubating the eggs .
313  the male helps , but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them .
314  the female spends the night incubating during this period , while the male roosts near the nest .
315 [147] eggs hatch at the same time , after a short incubation period lasting 1114 days , and exceptionally for as many as 17 or as few as 9.[8][131][160] the length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season .
316 [161]a female feeding a fledglingyoung house sparrows remain in the nest for 11 to 23 days , normally 14 to 16 days .
317 [107][161][162] during this time , they are fed by both parents .
318  as newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation they are brooded for a few days , or longer in cold conditions .
319 [161][163] the parents swallow the droppings produced by the hatchlings during the first few days; later , the droppings are moved up to 20 m (66 ft) away from the nest .
320 [163][164]the chicks' eyes open after about four days and , at an age of about eight days , the young birds get their first down .
321 [107][162] if both parents perish , the ensuing intensive begging sounds of the young will often attract replacement parents who feed them until they can sustain themselves .
322 [163][165] all the young in the nest leave it during the same period of a few hours .
323  at this stage they are normally able to fly .
324  they start feeding themselves partly after one or two days , and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days , 14 at the latest .
325 [166]survivalin adult house sparrows , annual survival is 4565% .
326 [167] after fledging and leaving the care of their parents , young sparrows have a high mortality rate , which lessens as they grow older and more experienced .
327  only about 2025% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season .
328 [168] the oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19 years and 9 months after it was ringed in denmark .
329 [169] the oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23 years .
330 [170] the typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data , but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual .
331 [171]predationthe house sparrow's main predators are cats and birds of prey , but many other animals prey on them , including corvids , squirrels ,[172] and even humansthe house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people in many parts of the world , and it still is in parts of the mediterranean .
332 [173] most species of bird of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where there are extensive records .
333  accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators , though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations .
334 [172] the house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on european roads , it is the bird most frequently found dead .
335 [174]parasites and diseasethe house sparrow is host to a huge number of parasites and diseases , and the effect of most is unknown .
336  ornithologist ted r .
337  anderson listed thousands , noting that his list was incomplete .
338 [175] the commonly recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans , and include salmonella and escherichia coli .
339 [176] salmonella is common in the house sparrow , and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested .
340  salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows .
341 [175] the house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria , which it has spread to the native forest birds of hawaii .
342 [177] many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals , for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host .
343 [178] arboviruses such as the west nile virus , which most commonly infect insects and mammals , survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow .
344 [175][179] there are a few records of disease extirpating house sparrow populations , especially from scottish islands , but this seems to be rare .
345 [180]the house sparrow is infested by a number of external parasites , which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows .
346  in europe , the most common mite found on sparrows is proctophyllodes , the most common ticks are argas reflexus and ixodes arboricola , and the most common flea on the house sparrow is ceratophyllus gallinae .
347  a number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrow's body .
348  menacanthus lice occur across the house sparrow's body , where they feed on blood and feathers , while brueelia lice feed on feathers and philopterus fringillae occurs on the head .
349 [144]physiologyhouse sparrows express strong circadian rhythms of activity in the laboratory .
350  they were among the first bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and photoperiodism , in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity , but also because they can "find their way" and remain rhythmic in constant darkness .
351 [181][182] such studies have found that the pineal gland is a central part of the house sparrow's circadian system: removal of the pineal eliminates the circadian rhythm of activity ,[183] and transplant of the pineal into another individual confers to this individual the rhythm phase of the donor bird .
352 [184] the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus have also been shown to be an important component of the circadian system of house sparrows .
353 [185] the photoreceptors involved in the synchronisation of the circadian clock to the external light-dark cycle are located in the brain and can be stimulated by light reaching them directly though the skull , as revealed by experiments in which blind sparrows , which normally can still synchronise to the light-dark cycle , failed to do so once india ink was injected as a screen under the skin on top of their skull .
354 [186]similarly , even when blind , house sparrows continue to be photoperiodic , i .
355 e .
356  show reproductive development when the days are long but not when the days are short .
357  this response is stronger when the feathers on top of the head are plucked , and is eliminated when india ink is injected under the skin at the top of the head , showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to daylength are located inside the brain .
358 [187]house sparrows have also been used in studies of nonphotic entrainment (i .
359 e .
360  synchronisation to an external cycle other than light and dark): for example , in constant darkness , a situation in which the birds would normally reveal their endogenous , non-24-hour , "free-running" rhythms of activity , they instead show 24-hour periodicity if they are exposed to two hours of chirp playbacks every 24 hours , matching their daily activity onsets with the daily playback onsets .
361 [188] house sparrows in constant dim light can also be entrained to a daily cycle based on the presence of food .
362 [189] finally , house sparrows in constant darkness can be entrained to a cycle of high and low temperature , but only if the difference between the two temperatures is large (38 versus 6 degrees celsius); some of the tested sparrows matched their activity to the warm phase , and others to the cold phase .
363 [190]relationships with humansthe house sparrow is closely associated with humans .
364  they are believed to have become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago .
365  subspecies bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral non-commensal populations .
366 [191] usually , it is regarded as a pest , since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals .
367 [192] even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds .
368 [77] in most of the world the house sparrow is not protected by law .
369  attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping , poisoning , or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly , blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise , glue , or porcupine wire .
370 [193] however , the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans as well , especially by eating insect pests , and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed .
371 [39]the house sparrow has long been used as a food item .
372  from around 1560 to at least the nineteenth century in northern europe , earthenware "sparrow pots" were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so that the young could be readily harvested .
373  wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers , and sparrow pie was a traditional dish , thought , because of the association of sparrows with lechery , to have aphrodisiac properties .
374  sparrows were also trapped as food for falconers' birds and zoo animals .
375  in the early part of the twentieth century , sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest , but with only a localised impact on numbers .
376 [194] house sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history , though they have no bright plumage or attractive songs , and raising them is difficult .
377 [195]statusthe house sparrow has an extremely large range and population , and is not seriously threatened by human activities , so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the iucn red list .
378 [1] however , populations have been declining in many parts of the world .
379 [196][197][198] these declines were first noticed in north america , where they were initially attributed to the spread of the house finch , but have been most severe in western europe .
380 [199][200] declines have not been universal , as no serious declines have been reported from eastern europe , but have even occurred in australia , where the house sparrow was introduced recently .
381 [201]in great britain , populations peaked in the early 1970s ,[202] but have since declined by 68% overall ,[203] and about 90% in some regions .
382 [204][205] in london , the house sparrow almost disappeared from the central city .
383 [204] the numbers of house sparrows in the netherlands have dropped in half since the 1980s ,[94] so the house sparrow is even considered an endangered species .
384 [206] this status came to widespread attention after a female house sparrow , referred to as the "dominomus", was killed after knocking down dominoes arranged as part of an attempt to set a world record .
385 [207] these declines are not unprecedented , as similar reductions in population occurred when the internal combustion engine replaced horses in the 1920s and a major source of food in the form of grain spillage was lost .
386 [208][209]various causes for the dramatic decreases in population have been proposed , including predation , in particular by eurasian sparrowhawks;[210][211][212] electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones;[213] and diseases .
387 [214] a shortage of nesting sites caused by changes in urban building design is probably a factor , and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows .
388 [214][215][216][217][218] a primary cause of the decline seems to be an insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows .
389 [214][219] declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops , the heavy use of pesticides ,[220][221][222] the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas ,[223][224] and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol , which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite .
390 [225]protecting insect habitats on farms ,[226][227] and planting native plants in cities benefit the house sparrow , as does establishing urban green spaces .
391 [228][229] to raise awareness of threats to the house sparrow , world sparrow day has been celebrated on 20 march across the world since 2010.[230] over the recent years , the house sparrow population has been on the decline in many asian countries and this decline is quite evident in india .
392 to promote the conservation of these birds , in 2012, the then chief minister of delhi , ms .
393  sheila dikshit , declared the house sparrow as the state bird of delhi .
394 [231][232]cultural associationsto many people across the world , the house sparrow is the most familiar wild animal and , because of its association with humans and familiarity , it is frequently used to represent the common and vulgar , or the lewd .
395 [233] one of the reasons for the introduction of house sparrows throughout the world was their association with the european homeland of many immigrants .
396 [81] birds usually described later as sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in europe and western asia .
397  these references may not always refer specifically to the house sparrow , or even to small , seed-eating birds , but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow in mind .
398 [39][233][234] in particular , sparrows were associated by the ancient greeks with aphrodite , the goddess of love , due to their perceived lustfulness , an association echoed by later writers such as chaucer and shakespeare .
399 [39][195][233][235] jesus's use of "sparrows" as an example of divine providence in the gospel of matthew[236] also inspired later references , such as that in shakespeare's hamlet[233] and the gospel hymn his eye is on the sparrow .
400 [237]the house sparrow is only represented in ancient egyptian art very rarely , but an egyptian hieroglyph is based on it .
401  the sparrow hieroglyph had no phonetic value and was used as a determinative in words to indicate small , narrow , or bad .
402 [238] an alternative view is that the hieroglyph meant "a prolific man" or "the revolution of a year" .
