5  distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world , in southern europe it is rather localized .
6  in north america it is more widely distributed , and it is ubiquitous across the sun belt of the united states and in the neotropics .
7  the old world population is often referred to as the great white egret .
8  this species is sometimes confused with the great white heron of the caribbean , which is a white morph of the closely related great blue heron (a .
9  herodias) .
10 ==description==the great egret is a large heron with all-white plumage .
11  standing up to {convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on} tall , this species can measure {convert|80|to|104|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and have a wingspan of {convert|131|to|170|cm|abbr=on} .
12  body mass can range from {convert|700|to|1500|g|lb|abbr=on}, with an average of around {convert|1000|g|lb|abbr=on} .
13  it is thus only slightly smaller than the great blue or grey heron (a .
14  cinerea) .
15  apart from size , the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet , though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season .
16  in breeding plumage , delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back .
17  males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults .
18  differentiated from the intermediate egret (mesophoyx intermedius) by the gape , which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the great egret , but ends just behind the eye in case of the intermediate egret .
19 it has a slow flight , with its neck retracted .
20  this is characteristic of herons and bitterns , and distinguishes them from storks , cranes , ibises , and spoonbills , which extend their necks in flight .
21 the great egret is not normally a vocal bird; it gives a low hoarse croak when disturbed , and at breeding colonies , it often gives a loud croaking cuk cuk cuk and higher-pitched squawks .

25 jpg|in flight ==systematics and taxonomy==like all egrets , it is a member of the heron family , ardeidae .
26  traditionally classified with the storks in the ciconiiformes , the ardeidae are closer relatives of pelicans and belong in the pelecaniformes instead .
27  the great egretunlike the typical egretsdoes not belong to the genus egretta but together with the great herons is today placed in ardea .
28  in the past , however , it was sometimes placed in egretta or separated in a monotypic genus casmerodius .

32  modesta from asia and australasia some taxonomists consider a full species , the eastern great egret (ardea modesta) .
33 ==ecology and status==the great egret is partially migratory , with northern hemisphere birds moving south from areas with colder winters .
34  it breeds in colonies in trees close to large lakes with reed beds or other extensive wetlands .
35  it builds a bulky stick nest .
36 the great egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range .
37  in north america , large numbers of great egrets were killed around the end of the 19th century so that their plumes could be used to decorate hats .
38  numbers have since recovered as a result of conservation measures .
39  its range has expanded as far north as southern canada .
40  however , in some parts of the southern united states , its numbers have declined due to habitat loss .
41  nevertheless , it adapts well to human habitation and can be readily seen near wetlands and bodies of water in urban and suburban areas .
42  in 1953, the great egret in flight was chosen as the symbol of the national audubon society , which was formed in part to prevent the killing of birds for their feathers .
43 the great egret is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
44 on 22 may 2012, it was announced a pair of great egrets were nesting in the uk for the first time at the shapwick heath nature reserve in somerset .
45  the species is a rare visitor to the uk and ben aviss of the bbc stated that the news could mean the uk's first great egret colony is established .
46  the following week , kevin anderson of natural england confirmed a great egret chick had hatched , making it a new breeding bird record for the uk .
47  anderson commented "we've definitely seen one chick stretching a wing just before the adult arrived and also after it left and we continue to monitor for more .
48  the eggs of the great egret can hatch over a period of a few days so it may be that if there are other young on the nest they will be less developed and won't be visible yet .
49 "== diet ==the great egret feeds in shallow water or drier habitats , feeding mainly on fish , frogs , small mammals , and occasionally small reptiles and insects , spearing them with its long , sharp bill most of the time by standing still and allowing the prey to come within its striking distance of its bill which it uses as a spear .
50  it will often wait motionless for prey , or slowly stalk its victim .
51 ==parasites==a thorough study performed by j .
52  sitko and p .
53  heneberg in the czech republic in years 1962-2013 suggested that the central european great egrets host 17 helminth species .
54  the dominant species consisted of apharyngostrigea cornu (45% prevalence), pegosomum sp .
55  (39% prevalence), uroproctepisthmium bursicola (29% prevalence), posthodiplostomum cuticola (21% prevalence) and porrocaecum ardeae (11% prevalence) .
56  juvenile great egrets were shown to host fewer species , but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult egrets .
57  of the digeneans found in central european great egrets , numerous species likely infected their definitive hosts outside of central europe itself .
58 ==in culture==the great egret is depicted on the reverse side of a 5-brazilian reais banknote .
59 white egrets is the title of saint lucian poet derek walcott's fourteenth collection of poems .
