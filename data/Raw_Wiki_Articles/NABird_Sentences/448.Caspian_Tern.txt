0 hydroprogne tschegravathe caspian tern (hydroprogne caspia , formerly sterna caspia) is a species of tern , with a subcosmopolitan but scattered distribution .
1  despite its extensive range , it is monotypic of its genus , and has no subspecies accepted either .
2  in new zealand it is also known by the maori name taranui .
3 == description ==it is the world's largest tern with a length of {convert|48||60|cm|in|abbr=on}, a wingspan of {convert|127||145|cm|in|abbr=on} and a weight of {convert|530|-|782|g|abbr=on} .
4   adult birds have black legs , and a long thick red-orange bill with a small black tip .
5  they have a white head with a black cap and white neck , belly and tail .
6  the upper wings and back are pale grey; the underwings are pale with dark primary feathers .
7  in flight , the tail is less forked than other terns and wing tips black on the underside .
8  in winter , the black cap is still present (unlike many other terns), but with some white streaking on the forehead .
9  the call is a loud heron-like croak .
10 == distribution and habitat ==their breeding habitat is large lakes and ocean coasts in north america (including the great lakes), and locally in europe (mainly around the baltic sea and black sea), asia , africa , and australasia (australia and new zealand) .
11  north american birds migrate to southern coasts , the west indies and northernmost south america .
12  european and asian birds spend the non-breeding season in the old world tropics .
13  african and australasian birds are resident or disperse over short distances .
14 the global population is about 50,000 pairs; numbers in most regions are stable , but the baltic sea population (14001475 pairs in the early 1990s) is declining and of conservation concern .
15 the caspian tern is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
16 == behaviour ===== feeding ===they feed mainly on fish , which they dive for , hovering high over the water and then plunging .
17  they also occasionally eat large insects , the young and eggs of other birds and rodents .
18  they may fly up to {convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on} from the breeding colony to catch fish; it often fishes on freshwater lakes as well as at sea .
19 === breeding ===breeding is in spring and summer , with one to three pale blue green eggs , with heavy brown spotting , being laid .
20  they nest either together in colonies , or singly in mixed colonies of other tern and gull species .
21  the nest is on the ground among gravel and sand , or sometimes on vegetation; incubation lasts for 2628 days .
22  the chicks are variable in plumage pattern , from pale creamy to darker grey-brown; this variation assists adults in recognizing their own chicks when returning to the colony from feeding trips .
23  fledging occurs after 3545 days .
