0 ==range==it breeds in eastern north america from southernmost canada and south through the eastern united states , excluding florida and the coast .
1  the louisiana waterthrush is migratory , wintering in central america and the west indies .
2  this is a rare vagrant to the western united states .
3  they are one of the earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring , often completing their migration in late march or early april , which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds .
4  they are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds , with some departing as early as july; almost all will have left by late august .
5 ==description==the louisiana waterthrush has a plain brown back and white underparts streaked with black .
6  the flanks and undertail are buff .
7  there is a strong white flared supercilium , and the legs are bright pink .
8  all plumages are similar , but young birds have buff underparts rather than white .
9  the main confusion species is the closely related  northern waterthrush (parkesia noveboracensis), which has white flanks and undertail , a striped throat , a slightly smaller bill , a shorter supercilium and duller pink legs .
10 in a study of the two waterthrushes in connecticut nesting grounds , the louisiana waterthrush , at an average of {convert|20.6|g|oz|abbr=on}, was rather larger than the northern , at an average of {convert|16.2|g|oz|abbr=on} .
11  the louisiana waterthrush is one of the largest species of wood warbler , with only the aberrant yellow-breasted chat averaging larger in mean mass and linear measurements .
12  it measures {convert|14|-|17|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and spanning {convert|21|-|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wings .
13  the weight of adult birds can vary from {convert|17.4|to|28|g|oz|abbr=on} .
14  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|7.4|to|8.5|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail {convert|4.4|to|5.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1.2|to|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2|to|2.3|cm|in|abbr=on} .
15 the male's song is a musical , distinctive series of descending notes followed by a warble .
16  the pitch of the beginning notes of the louisiana's song usually descend , just as does the hilly stream that is its preferred habitat , whereas in the northern waterthrush the song does not vary in pitch as much .
17  the call is a hard chink .
18 like the closely related northern waterthrush , the louisiana waterthrush frequently bobs its tail .
19 ==ecology==the male louisiana waterthrush does not sing on its wintering grounds before it leaves .
20  it sings immediately when it arrives on its breeding territory .
21  whether it begins singing during migration is not known .
22  when establishing his territory , a male sings vigorously nearly all day .
23  after he acquires a mate , singing decreases quickly and he concentrates his singing into the morning hours .
24  the breeding habitat is wet woodlands near running water and does not occur outside such areas as a breeder .
25  however , during winter , the louisiana waterthrush mainly forages along flooded roads or trails , and in parks , lawns and gardens , rarely entering true forest , even forested wetlands , in the subtropics .
26  the northern waterthrush prefers stagnant , swampy waters and is generally a more terrestrial forager .
27  louisiana waterthrushes prefer dense vegetation along the water's edge for nesting , since this provides the main protection of nest from predation .
28  louisiana waterthrushes nest in a rock crevice , mud bank or amongst tree roots , laying 46 eggs in a cup nest from late may to mid-june .
29  both parents construct the nest , which is built from wet , muddy leaves , pine needles , grass , and small twigs .
30  the female louisiana waterthrush incubates the eggs for 12 or 13 days .
31  the fledging period lasts for 9 or 10 days , with both adults feeding the young for a further 4 weeks .
32 they are one of a few passerine species that does most of its foraging in actively running water , which only the dippers are known for at the family level .
33  mostly they depend on aquatic insects , molluscs , and crustaceans .
34  occasionally ground-based insects , such as beetles and ants are taken , as well as flying insects , such as flies , which may be hawked on the wing .
35  alternately , they forage amongst the leaf litter .
36  in circumstances where the insect prey is low , louisiana waterthrushes can target prey as large as salamanders and small fish .
37 ==status==less common and widespread today than it was two centuries ago , the louisiana waterthrush's decline is mainly due to the reduction of suitable habitat , through clearing and channelization of streams , as well as pollution , and the impounding of rivers and streams to create reservoirs .
38  additionally , because the louisiana waterthrush is dependent on large areas of continuous forest , this species is likely to be threatened by increasing forest fragmentation .
39  timber harvesting , agriculture , urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species .
40  the population seems be quite extremely sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity .
41  threats to the canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage , excessive irrigation and climate change , as well as logging and habitat fragmentation .
