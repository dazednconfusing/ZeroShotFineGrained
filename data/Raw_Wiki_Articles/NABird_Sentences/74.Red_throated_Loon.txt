0 the red-throated loon or red-throated diver (gavia stellata) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere .
1  the most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family , it breeds primarily in arctic regions , and winters in northern coastal waters .
2  ranging from 5567 centimetres (2226 in) in length , the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons .
3  in winter , it is a nondescript bird , greyish above fading to white below .
4  during the breeding season , it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name .
5  fish form the bulk of its diet , though amphibians , invertebrates and plant material are sometimes eaten as well .
6  a monogamous species , the red-throated loon forms long-term pair bonds .
7  both members of the pair help to build the nest , incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch) and feed the hatched young .
8 the red-throated loon has a large global population and a significant global range , though some populations are declining .
9  oil spills , habitat degradation , pollution and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces .
10  natural predatorsincluding various gull species , and both red and arctic foxes , will take eggs and young .
11  the species is protected by a number of international treaties .
12 taxonomy and etymologyfirst described by danish naturalist erik pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species , with no distinctive subspecies despite its large holarctic range .
13 [2] pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now-defunct genus colymbus , which contained grebes as well as loons .
14  by 1788, however , german naturalist johann reinhold forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera , and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus .
15 [3] its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all belong to the same genus , it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology , behaviour , ecology and breeding biology ,[2] and may be the basal lineage of the genus .
16 [4] it is thought to have evolved in the palearctic , and then to have expanded into the nearctic .
17 [2]the genus name gavia comes from the latin for "sea mew", as used by ancient roman naturalist pliny the elder .
18 [5] the specific epithet stellata is latin for "set with stars" or "starry",[6] and refers to the bird's speckled back in its non-breeding plumage .
19 [5] "diver" refers to the family's underwater method of hunting for prey , while "red-throated" is a straightforward reference to the bird's most distinctive breeding plumage feature .
20  the word "loon" is thought to have derived from the swedish lom , the old norse or icelandic lmr , or the old dutch loen , all of which mean "lame" or "clumsy", and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land .
21 [7]descriptionthe red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loon species , ranging from 53 to 69 cm (21 to 27 in) in length[nb 1][9] with a 91120 cm (3647 in) wingspan ,[9][10] and weighing 12.7 kg (2.26.0 lb) .
22 [9] like all loons , it is long-bodied and short-necked , with its legs set far back on its body .
23 [11] the sexes are similar in appearance , although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females .
24 [2] in breeding plumage , the adult has a dark grey head and neck (with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck), a triangular red throat patch , white underparts and a dark grey-brown mantle .
25 [12] it is the only loon with an all-dark back in breeding plumage .
26 [13] the non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin , foreneck and much of the face white , the top of the head and back of the neck grey , and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle .
27 [12]its bill is thin , straight and sharp , and the bird often holds it at an uptilted angle .
28 [12] though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter , the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird's overall plumage change .
29  the nostrils are narrow slits located near the base of the bill ,[11] and the iris is reddish .
30 [14] one of the bird's north american folk names is pegging-awl loon , a reference to its sharply pointed bill , which resembles a sailmaker's awl (a tool also known as a "pegging awl" in new england) .
31 [15]like the other members of its genus , the red-throated loon is well-adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge , its legsin their set-back positionprovide excellent propulsion and its body is long and streamlined .
32  even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining .
33  its feet are large , its front three toes are fully webbed , and its tarsus is flattened , which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water .
34 [16]adult in breeding plumage in icelandwhen it first emerges from its egg , the young red-throated loon is covered with fine soft down feathers .
35  primarily dark brown to dark grey above , it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck , as well as on its throat , chest , and flanks , with a pale grey lower breast and belly .
36  within weeks , this first down is replaced by a second , paler set of down feathers , which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers .
37 [14] the juvenile's plumage is similar to that of the adult , though with a few distinguishing features .
38  it has a darker forehead and neck , with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat .
39  its back is browner and less speckled , and its underparts are tinged with brown .
40  its eyes are reddish-brown , and its beak is a pale grey .
41  though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter , many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults , except for their paler bills .
42 [12]in flight , the red-throated loon has a distinctive profile; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body , its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back .
43  it has a quicker , deeper wingbeat than do other loons .
44 [17]voicethe adult red-throated loon has a number of vocalisations , which are used in different circumstances .
45  in flight , when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond , it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles - kaa-kaa-kaa or kak-kak-kak , at roughly five calls per second .
46  its warning call , if disturbed by humans or onshore predators , is a short croaking bark .
47  a low-pitched moaning call , used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young , but also during copulation , is made with the bill closed .
48  the species also has a short wailing call - aarooaoaarooao , which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch , this meowing call is more musical than its other calls .
49  another call  a harsh , pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch , and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a rowis used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding , and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water .
50 [18] known as the "long call", it is often given in duet , which is unusual among the loons;[19] the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's .
51 [18]young have a shrill closed-bill call , which they use in begging and to contact their parents .
52  they also have a long call used in response to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults .
53 [18]similar speciesat medium to close range , an adult red-throated loon in either breeding or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised .
54  however , in certain light conditions , at certain times in its moulting cycle or at greater distances , it may be mistaken for another speciesmost commonly the black-throated loon , but also occasionally the great crested grebe .
55  it shows more white on the head and neck than does the black-throated loon , andprovided it is not sitting low in the watertends to show more white on the flanks as well .
56  if it is sitting lower in the water , so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated .
57 [20]habitat and distributionthe red-throated loon breeds primarily in the arctic regions of northern eurasia and north america (generally north of 50n latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters ,[21] sometimes in groups of considerable size .
58  more than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the german bight , for example .
59 [22] unlike other loons , it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites .
60 in north america , it winters regularly along both coasts , ranging as far south as the baja california peninsula and the gulf of california in north-western mexico; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior mexican state of hidalgo .
61 [23] some of its folk names in north-eastern north americaincluding cape race , cape brace , cape drake and cape racer , as well as corruptions such as scapegraceoriginated from its abundance around cape race , newfoundland .
62 [24] in europe , it breeds in iceland , northern scotland , north-western ireland (a few pairs only), scandinavia and northern russia , and winters along the coast as far south as parts of spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways , including the mediterranean , aegean and black seas , as well as large rivers , lakes and reservoirs .
63 [25] it has occurred as a vagrant as far south as morocco , tunisia and the gambia .
64 [1] in asia , it breeds in the northern stretches of siberia , and winters along the pacific coast as far south as china , japan and taiwan .
65  it has occurred as a vagrant in mongolia .

67 among the loons , the red-throated loon is exceptional in its ability to take off from very small bodies of water .
68 because its feet are located so far back on its body , the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land; however , it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast .
69 [17] young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water , including rivers and the sea .
70 [26] it is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land .
71 [27] if frightened , it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the surface of the water .
72 [28]the red-throated loon is a diurnal migrant , which travels singly or in loose groups , often high above the water .
73 [17] in eastern north america (and possibly elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore;[29] siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern european wintering grounds .
74 [30] it is a strong flier , and has been clocked at speeds between 75 and 78 kilometres per hour (47 and 48 mph) .
75 [31] like all members of its family , the red-throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing moult , losing all its flight feathers at once and becoming flightless for a period of three to four weeks .
76  however , unlike other loonswhich undergo this moult in late winterthe red-throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn .
77 [32]food and feedingtwo small fuzzy blackish chicksone swallowing a silver fishfloat on water beside a larger bird with a black back and grey neck .
78 once they are 34 days old , the young are fed fishwhich can be quite large compared to the size of the chick .
79 like all members of its family , the red-throated loon is primarily a fish-eater , though it sometimes feeds on molluscs , crustaceans , frogs , aquatic invertebrates , insects , fish spawn or even plant material .
80 [21] it seizes rather than spears its prey , which is generally captured underwater .
81 [33] though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion , it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly .
82 [34] pursuit dives range from 29 m (6.629.5 ft) in depth , with an average underwater time of about a minute .
83 [21] its fish diet increases the red-throated loon's vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals , both of which bioaccumulate , thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) at or near the top of the food chain .
84 [35] its main diet has also led to several of the loon's british folk names , including "sprat borer" and "spratoon" .
85 [36]for the first few days after hatching , young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents .
86  after 34 days , the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole .
87  by four weeks of age , the young can eat the same foodof the same sizeas their parents do .
88 [37] young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the united kingdom , hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas .
89 [38][39]breeding and survivalsmall fuzzy black chick floats beside a larger bird on calm water with a muddy bank and tall grass in the backgroundchicks are competent swimmers , able to accompany their parents soon after hatching .
90 the red-throated loon is a monogamous species which forms long-term pair bonds .
91  both sexes build the nest , which is a shallow scrape (or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers , and placed within a half-metre (18 in) of the edge of a small pond .
92  the female lays two eggs (though clutches of one and three have also been recorded); they are incubated for 2429 days , primarily by the female .
93  the eggs , which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black , measure 75 mm  46 mm (3.0 in  1.8 in) and have a mass of 83 g (2.9 oz), of which 8% is shell .
94 [33][40] incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid , so they hatch asynchronously .
95  if a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding , for example) before the young hatch , the red-throated loon usually lays a second clutch , generally in a new nest .
96 [41] the young birds are precocial upon hatching: downy and mobile with open eyes .
97  both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially , then small fish for 3848 days .
98  parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young .
99 [33] ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do[33] and others the opposite .
100 [9]in the wild , the oldest known red-throated loon lived for more than two decades;[21] it was found , oiled and dead , on a beach in sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been ringed (banded) .
101 [42]conservation status and threatsalthough the red-throated loon is not a globally threatened species , as it has a large population and a significant range , there are populations which appear to be declining .
102  numbers counted in u.s.
104  fish and wildlife service surveys in alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example ,[43] and counts have dropped in continental europe as well .
105 [44] in scotland , on the other hand , the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the royal society for the protection of birds and scottish natural heritage .
106 [44] in 2002, wetlands international estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000 individuals; global population trends have not been quantified .
107 [1]the red-throated loon is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies;[45] in the americas , it is protected by the migratory bird treaty act of 1918.[46] oil spills , habitat degradation , and fishing nets are among the main threats this species faces .
108 [9] because it tends to migrate close to shoregenerally within 20 kilometres (12 mi) of landit may be detrimentally affected by the construction of near-shore wind farms;[47] studies indicate a high level of avoidance of wind farm areas , though deaths due to direct strikes with the turbines appear to be uncommon .
109 [48] high levels of mercury in the environment have led to reproductive failures in some areas , including parts of sweden .
110 [49] studies in sweden have also shown that they may be adversely impacted by the acidification of lakes , as the fish on which they prey are susceptible to low ph .
111 [50] on the breeding grounds , arctic and red foxes are major predators of eggs ,[51] while great skuas , arctic skuas and various species of larus gulls (including great black-backed gulls and glaucous gulls)[52][53] are predators of both eggs and young .
112 [54]the species is known to serve as host for at least 51 species of parasites , most of which are roundworms (nematodes), flatworms (digeneans) and tapeworms (cestodes) carried internally; a single species of louse is its only known external parasite .
113 [55] it is also known to sometimes carry significant populations of diatoms (microscopic phytoplankton) on its contour feathers .
114 [56] the red-throated loon is susceptible to avian influenza[57] and type e botulism ,[58] and is regularly killed by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by "red tide" algal blooms .
115 [59] during a 2007 bloom , large numbers of the birds also died of hypothermia , after their plumages became matted by a protein byproduct of the algae , which reduced the insulating properties of their feathers .
116 [60]in human culturegreyish bird with white speckles on its back and a sharply pointed grey bill floats on waterjuveniles have fewer speckles on their backs and darker necks than adults do .
117 used as a food source since prehistoric times ,[61][62] the red-throated loon is still hunted by indigenous peoples in some parts of the world today .
118 [63] eggs as well as birds are taken , sometimes in significant numbers; during one study on northern canada's igloolik island , 73% of all red-throated loon eggs laid within the 10 km2 (3.9 mi2) study site over two breeding seasons were collected by indigenous inhabitants of the island .
119 [64] in some parts of russia , red-throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations , including collars .
120 [65] the species was also central to the creation mythologies of indigenous groups throughout the holarctic .
121 [66] according to the mythwhich varies only slightly between versions , despite the sometimes-vast distances that separated the groups who believed itthe loon was asked by a great shaman to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea .
122  that earth was then used to build the world's dry land .
123 [66][67]as recently as the 1800s , the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time , birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather , while those flying out to sea or giving long , wailing cries predicted rain .
124 [40][44] in the orkney and shetland islands of scotland , the species is still known as the "rain goose" in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities .
125 [44] the people of the faroe islands believed that if the red-throated loon miaowed like a cat , then rain was imminent , while a call of gaa-gaa-gaa or turkatrae-turkatrae predicted fine weather .
126 [68]bhutan , japan and the union of the comoros have issued stamps featuring the red-throated loon .
