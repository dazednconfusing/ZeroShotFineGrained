0 the long-billed curlew (numenius americanus) is a large north american shorebird of the family scolopacidae .
1  this species was also called "sicklebird" and the "candlestick bird" .
2  the species is native to central and western north america .
3  in the winter , the species migrates southwards , as well as towards the coastline .
4 ==description==the long-billed curlew is the largest nesting or regularly occurring sandpiper in north america .
5  it is {convert|50|-|65|cm|in|abbr=on} long , {convert|62|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wing and weighs {convert|490|-|950|g|lb|abbr=on} .
6  its disproportionally long bill measures {convert|11.3|-|21.9|cm|in|abbr=on}, and rivals the bill of the larger-bodied far eastern curlew as the longest bill of any shorebird .
7  adults have a very long bill curved downwards , a long neck and a small head .
8  the neck and underparts are a light cinnamon , while the crown is streaked with brown .
9  this species exhibits sexual dimorphism , the female having a much longer bill than the male .
10 ==breeding==their breeding habitat is grasslands in west-central north america .
11  the species displays an elaborate courtship dance during breeding season .
12  fast and looping display flights are also common .
13  a small hollow is lined with various weeds and grasses to serve as the nest .
14  four eggs are always laid as this is a characteristic of shorebirds .
15  the eggs vary in hue from white to olive .
16  the long-billed curlew is a precocial bird , and the chicks leave the nest soon after hatching .
17  both parents look after the young .
18 ==feeding==the bird usually feeds in flocks .
19  using its long bill , it probes the mud near its habitat , foraging for suitable food .
20  the usual food consists of crabs and various other small invertebrates .
21  the species also feeds on grasshoppers , beetles and other insects .
22  this bird has occasionally been known to eat the eggs of other birds .
23 ==conservation status==the population was significantly reduced at the end of the 19th century by hunting .
24  numbers have rebounded somewhat in more recent times .
25  it was formerly classified as a near threatened species by the iucn , but new research has confirmed that the long-billed curlew is again common and widespread .
26  consequently , it is downlisted to least concern status in 2008.candlestick point in san francisco was named after this indigenous bird , and subsequently candlestick park stadium inherited the name .
27  ironically , the species had dramatically declined in the san francisco area by the early 20th century already , being "practically extinct" in san mateo county in 1916. by the time the stadium was constructed in the 1950s , the last remnants of the flocks of "candlestick birds"  which formerly numbered in the thousands  were being shot by hunters until , at least temporarily , none were left .
