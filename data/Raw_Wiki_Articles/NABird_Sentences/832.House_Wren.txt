0 the house wren (troglodytes aedon) is a very small songbird of the wren family , troglodytidae .
1  it occurs from canada to southernmost south america , and is thus the most widely distributed bird in the americas .
2  it occurs in most suburban areas in its range and it is the single most common wren .
3  its taxonomy is highly complex and some subspecies groups are often considered separate species .
4 ==description==adults are {convert|11|to|13|cm|in|abbr=on} long , with a {convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan and weigh about {convert|10|to|12|g|oz|abbr=on} .
5  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|4.7|to|5.3|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|3.9|to|4.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the culmen is {convert|1.1|to|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|1.6|to|1.8|cm|in|abbr=on} .
6  the subspecies vary greatly , with upperparts ranging from dull greyish-brown to rich rufescent-brown , and the underparts ranging from brown , over buff and pale grey , to pure white .
7  all subspecies have blackish barring to the wings and tail , and some also to the flanks .
8  all subspecies show a faint eye-ring and eyebrow and have a long , thin bill with a blackish upper mandible , and a black-tipped yellowish or pale grey lower mandible .
9  the legs are pinkish or grey .
10  the short tail is typically held cocked .
11 this bird's rich bubbly song is commonly heard during the nesting season but rarely afterwards .
12  there is marked geographical variation in the song , though somewhat more gradual than in the bird's outward appearance that can strikingly differ , e .

14 , on neighboring islands in the caribbean .
15  birds from far north and south of the species' range nonetheless have songs that differ markedly .
16 ==systematics and taxonomy==the house wren is usually divided into three distinct subspecies groups and one or several distinct island-endemic subspecies .
17  some or all of these are often considered distinct species .
18 it has also been suggested that the taxa from the lesser antilles represent one or more separate species ,  but there is less agreement as to their subdivision , because as far as they have been studied to date , there is little clear biogeographical structure among these populations .

23 ==ecology==in north america , the house wren is thought to achieve the highest density in floodplain forests in the western great plains where it uses woodpecker holes as nesting sites .
24  in south and central america it can be found in virtually any habitat and is , as indicated by its common name , often associated with humans .
25  north american birds migrate to the southern united states and mexico for winter .
26  most return to the breeding grounds in late april to may , and leave for winter quarters again around september to early october .
27  these birds forage actively in vegetation .
28  they mainly eat insects such as butterfly larvae , also spiders and snails .
29  southern house wrens rarely attend mixed-species feeding flocks .
30 ===reproduction===the nesting habits do not seem to differ significantly between the northern and southern house wrens at least .
31  they usually construct a large cup nest in various sorts of cavities , taking about a week to build .
32  the nest is made from small dry sticks and is usually lined with a variety of different materials .
33  these include: feather , hair , wool , spider cocoons , strips of bark , rootlets , moss , and trash .
34  the male wren finds dry sticks , which he adds to the nest .
35  once he is done , the female inspects at the nest; but if she does not approve of the construction , she will throw any unwanted sticks to the ground .
36  after this process , the female lines the nest .
37  nest cavities are usually a few meters above ground at most , but occasionally on cliffs as high up as {convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on} and more at least in southern populations{verify source|date=february 2008}; they may be natural or man-made , often using bird houses .
38 house wrens are feisty and pugnacious animals considering their tiny size .
39  they are known to occasionally destroy the eggs of other birds nesting in their territory by puncturing the eggshell .
40  they are also known to fill up other birds' nests within its territory with sticks to make them unusable .
41 {citation needed|date = june 2015}depending on the exact population , the house wrens' clutch is usually between two and eight red-blotched cream-white eggs , weighing about {convert|1.4|g|oz|abbr=on} each and measuring c .
42 {convert|17|and|13.4|mm|in|abbr=on} at the widest points .
43  only the female incubates these , for around 1219 days , and she will every now and then leave the nest for various reasons .
44  while she is on the nest , the male provisions her with food .
45  the young , which like all passerines hatch almost naked and helpless , take another 1519 days or so to fledge{citation needed|date=february 2008} .
46  they are being fed by both parents , and need plenty of food given their tiny size (see also bergmann's rule) .
47  as the young near fledging , the parents spend much of their time procuring food for them .
48  brood loss due to predation was found to be light in the southern andean yungas , with predation of nestling young being almost insignificant .
49  known predators of house wrens at the nest include cats , rats , opossums , woodpeckers , foxes , raccoons , squirrels , snakes and owls .
50  adults away from the nests can usually avoid these predators although both small hawks and owls occasionally take free-flying adult wrens .
51 migrant populations are nesting within 6 weeks of returning from winter quarters , leaving theoretically time for a second brood .
52  in the subtropical montane forest of northwestern argentina and similar habitat , the southern house wren breeds in the rainy summer months from late october to late december .
53 in washington , d .
54 c .
55  area , house wren parents made significantly more feeding trips per hour in suburban backyards compared to rural backyards .
56  yet rural nestlings grew at a faster rate than their suburban counterparts .
57  in addition , suburban parents spent less time brooding (sitting on the nest) compared to rural parents .
58  such results suggest that suburban backyard habitats offer house wrens food for nestlings that is inferior in either quality or quantity to what rural habitats offer .
59  food items may , for example , be smaller in suburban habitats , and force adults to make more trips to the box .
60 ===conservation status===the house wren may have been displaced somewhat in some northern parts of its range by the introduction of the house sparrow , but is still common and widespread throughout most of the americas .
61  it is not considered threatened by the iucn , though this would certainly not hold true for several of the islanhd population if they turn out to be true species .
62 some taxa , especially from the lesser antilles , are rare and highly endangered or possibly already extinct .
63  several factors seem to have contributed to a varying degree to the decline of these birds , namely habitat destruction , predation by introduced mongooses , and hurricanes:the saint vincent wren (troglodytes aedon musicus) of saint vincent was close to extinction in the mid-late 20th century; it has since recovered and today is not uncommonas remarked above , these are variously placed in t .
64  musculus if that is considered distinct , or as one or several distinct species .
65 ==in culture==john james audubon illustrates the house wren in birds of america (published , london 182738) as plate 83. the image was engraved and colored by the robert havell , london workshops .
66  the original watercolor by audubon was purchased by the new york history society .
67 {citation needed|date = june 2015}troglodytes aedon was one of the two pets of king friday the xviii in mister rogers' neighborhood .
68  trog , as the king called him , was a wooden wren on a stick , and trog had his own song .
69  king friday's other pet was a mockingbird (also a wooden bird on a stick) named mimus polyglottos (see neighborhood of make-believe) .
70 brazilian footballer garrincha earned his nickname from one of the names the house wren has in rio de janeiro .
