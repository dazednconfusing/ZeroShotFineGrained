0 the western bluebird (sialia mexicana) is a small thrush , about {convert|15|to|18|cm|in|abbr=on} in length .
1  adult males are bright blue on top and on the throat with an orange breast and sides , a brownish patch on back , and a gray belly and undertail coverts .
2  adult females have a duller blue body , wings , and tail than the male , a gray throat , a dull orange breast , and a gray belly and undertail coverts .
3  immature western bluebirds have duller colors than the adults , they also have spots on their chest and back .
4  these color patterns help play a part in the mating ritual , when males compete for breeding rights to females .
5 they are sometimes confused with other bluebirds , but they can be distinguished without difficulty .
6  the western bluebird has a blue (male) or gray (female) throat , the eastern bluebird has an orange throat , and the mountain bluebird lacks orange color anywhere on its body .
7  it has a stocky build , and a thin straight beak with a fairly short tail .
8  its posture consists of perching upright on wire fences and high perches .
9  the western bluebird pounces on the ground when looking for food , such as worms and berries .
10  it also flies to catch aerial prey , like insects , when available .
11  the western bluebird consumes water from nearby streams and commonly used bird baths .
12 ==nesting=====nesting habitat===the western bluebird has been chased out of its natural habitat due to the cutting down of trees; however the western bluebird has adapted to coniferous forests , farmlands , semi-open terrain , and desert to survive .
13  the year-round range includes california , the southern rocky mountains , arizona , and new mexico in the united states , and as far south as the states of oaxaca and veracruz in mexico .
14  the summer breeding range extends as far north as the pacific northwest , british columbia , and montana .
15  northern birds can migrate to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents .
16 they nest in cavities or in nest boxes , competing with tree swallows , house sparrows , and european starlings for natural nesting locations .
17  because of the high level of competition , house sparrows often attack western bluebirds for their nests .
18  the attacks are made both in groups or alone .
19  attacks by starlings can be reduced if the nesting box opening is kept to {convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on} diameter to avoid takeover .
20  nest boxes come into effect when the species is limited and dying out due to the following predators: cats , raccoons , possums , and select birds of prey such as the coopers hawk .
21  ants , bees , earwigs , and wasps can crawl into the nesting boxes and damage the newborns .
22   western bluebirds are among the birds that nest in [cavities], or holes in trees , or nest boxes .
23  their [beak]s are too weak and small to dig out their own holes , so they rely on [woodpecker]s to make their nest sites for them .
24 ===nest type and habitat comparison===in restored forests , western bluebirds have a higher probability of successfully fledging young than in untreated forests , but they are at greater risk of parasitic infestations .
25  the effects on post-fledging survival are unknown .
26  they have been found to enjoy more success with nest boxes than in natural cavities .
27  they started egg-laying earlier , had higher nesting success and lower predation rates , and fledged more young in boxes than in cavities , but they did not have larger clutches of eggs .
28 the eggs are commonly two to eight per clutch , with average size {convert|20.8|x|16.2|mm|in|abbr=on} .
29  eggs are oval in shape with a smooth and glossy shell .
30  they are pale blue to bluish-white and sometimes white in color .
31  nestlings remain in a nest about 19 to 22 days before fledging .
32 ===rearing of young===in a good year , the parents can rear two broods , with four to six eggs per clutch .
33  according to genetic studies , 45% of western bluebirds' nests carried young that were not offspring of the male partner .
34  in addition , they help their parents raise a new brood after their own nest fails .
35 these birds wait on a perch and fly down to catch insects , sometimes catching them in midair .
36  they mainly eat insects and berries .
37  during the breeding season , bluebirds are very helpful with pest control in the territory surrounding the nest .
38 ====calls and songs====their calling consists of the mating songs which sound like cheer , chur-chur , and chup .
39  this helps male western bluebirds find the females easily in condensed f chweer or che-cheek , to tell [competing] males that the [territory] belongs to them .
