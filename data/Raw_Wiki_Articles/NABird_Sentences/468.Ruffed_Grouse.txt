0 the ruffed grouse (bonasa umbellus) is a medium-sized grouse occurring in forests from the appalachian mountains across canada to alaska .
1  it is non-migratory .
2 the ruffed grouse is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a "partridge", an unrelated phasianid , and occasionally confused with the grey partridge , a bird of open areas rather than woodlands .
3 the ruffed grouse is the state bird of pennsylvania , usa .
4 ==taxonomy==bonasa umbellus was first described by linnaeus who classified it as tetrao umbellus , placing it in a subfamily with eurasian grouse .
5   the subfamily bonasa was applied by british naturalist john francis stephens in 1819.  ruffed grouse is the preferred common name because it applies only to this species .
6   misleading vernacular names abound , however , and it is often called partridge (sometimes rendered pa'tridge , or shortened to pat), pheasant , or prairie chicken , all of which are properly applied to other birds .
7  other nicknames for ruffed grouse include drummer or thunder-chicken .
8 there are 14 recognized subspecies of ruffed grouse:==description==these chunky , medium-sized birds weigh from {convert|450|-|750|g|lb|abbr=on}, measure from {convert|40|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and span {convert|50|-|64|cm|in|abbr=on} across their short , strong wings .
9  ruffed grouse have two distinct morphs , grey and brown .
10  in the grey morph , the head , neck and back are grey-brown; the breast is light with barring .
11  there is much white on the underside and flanks , and overall the birds have a variegated appearance; the throat is often distinctly lighter .
12  the tail is essentially the same brownish grey , with regular barring and a broad black band near the end ("subterminal") .
13  brown-morph birds have tails of the same color and pattern , but the rest of the plumage is much more brown , giving the appearance of a more uniform bird with less light plumage below and a conspicuously grey tail .
14  there are all sorts of intergrades between the most typical morphs; warmer and more humid conditions favor browner birds in general .
15 the ruffs are on the sides of the neck in both sexes .
16  they also have a crest on top of their head , which sometimes lies flat .
17  both genders are similarly marked and sized , making them difficult to tell apart , even in hand .
18  the female often has a broken subterminal tail band , while males tend to have unbroken tail bands , though the opposite of either can occur .
19  females may also do a display similar to the male .
20  another fairly accurate sign is that rump feathers with a single white dot indicate a female; rump feathers with more than one white dot indicate a male .
21 ==ecology==like most grouse , they spend most of their time on the ground; mixed woodland rich in aspen seems to be particularly well-liked .
22  these birds forage on the ground or in trees .
23  they are omnivores , eating buds , leaves , berries , seeds , and insects .
24  according to nature writer don l .
25  johnson: "more than any other characteristic , it is the ruffed grouse's ability to thrive on a wide range of foods that has allowed it to adapt to such a wide and varied range of habitat on this continent .
26  a complete menu of grouse fare might itself fill a book .
27  one grouse crop yielded a live salamander in a salad of watercress .
28  another contained a small snake .
29 "==hunting==ruffed grouse frequently seek gravel and clover along road beds during early morning and late afternoon .
30  these are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds .
31  also , grouse use sandy road beds to dust their feathers to rid themselves of skin pests .
32  dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers .
33  birds will return to these spots during the late afternoon to bathe in dust and to socialize and mate .
34 {citation needed|date=december 2012}the ruffed grouse population has a cycle , and follows the cycle no matter how much or how little hunting there is .
35  the cycle has puzzled scientists for years , and is simply referred to as the "grouse cycle" .

38 {fv|date=march 2014}==behavior==the ruffed grouse differs from other grouse species in its courtship display .
39  unlike other grouse species , the ruffed grouse relies entirely on a non-vocal acoustic display , known as drumming .
40  the drumming itself is a rapid , wing-beating display that creates a low frequency sound , starting slow and speeding up (thump .

49  even in thick woods this can be heard for a quarter mile or more (~1/2 km) .
50 the ruffed grouse spends most of its time quietly on the ground , and when surprised , may explode into flight , beating their wings very loudly .
51  in the winter , they will burrow into the snow for warmth , and may suddenly burst out of the snow when approached too closely .
