0 northern band-tailed pigeon (patagioenas fasciata)the band-tailed pigeon (patagioenas fasciata) is a medium-sized bird of the americas .
1  its closest relatives are the chilean pigeon , passenger pigeon and the ring-tailed pigeon , which form a clade of patagioenas with a terminal tail band and iridescent plumage on their necks .
2  some authorities split this species into the northern band-tailed pigeon (patagioenas fasciata) and the southern band-tailed pigeon (patagioenas albilinea) .
3 it ranges from british columbia , washington , oregon , california , and southern arizona south in higher elevations through mexico and central america to northern argentina .
4  in autumn it migrates out of its permanent resident range into northern california , new mexico , and parts of utah and colorado .
5  populations from costa rica south are sometimes considered a separate species , the white-naped pigeon (p .
6  albilinea) .
7  it is found at altitudes from {convert|900|to|3600|m|ft|abbr=on|-3}, generally in oak , pine-oak , and coniferous forests .
8  it feeds on seeds , notably acorns .
9 ==description==it is the biggest pigeon in north america , measuring {convert|33|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on} long and weighing {convert|225|-|515|g|oz|abbr=on} .
10  the coastal subspecies p .
11  f .
12  monilis (averaging {convert|392|g|oz|abbr=on}) is larger than the inland subspecies (averaging {convert|340|g|oz|abbr=on}) .
13  the plumage is gray , somewhat darker above .
14  the head and underparts have a faint pink cast , especially in the adult male; the belly is nearly white .
15  the distal half of the tail is also pale (except in the subspecies of baja california), whence the english name .
16  the bill and feet are yellow , good identification marks at sufficiently close range .
17  adults have green iridescence on the back of the neck , adjacent to a thin white collar on the nape .
18  juvenile birds have white feather edges above , giving a scaly appearance .
19 ==behavior and ecology==this species is relatively quiet for a pigeon .
20  its voice is low-pitched and owl-like , often in two-syllable calls that rise and then fall (huu-ooh) with even spacing between calls .
21 it builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs , in which it lays one or two eggs .
22  outside the breeding season it forms flocks , sometimes over 50 birds , and often becomes nomadic , following the acorn crop or moving to lower altitudes or other areas outside its breeding range .
23  toyon berries are a food consumed by the band-tailed pigeon .
24  this species often visits bird feeders .
25 the parasitic louse columbicola extinctus , believed to have become extinct with the extinction of the passenger pigeon , was recently rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon .
26  the band-tailed pigeon is the closest genetic relative of the passenger pigeon and has been investigated for being used in efforts to bring back that extinct species .
