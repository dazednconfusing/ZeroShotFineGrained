0 the black-necked grebe (podiceps nigricollis), known in north america as the eared grebe , is a member of the grebe family of water birds .
1  it occurs on every continent except australia and antarctica .
2 taxonomythere are three subspecies:[2]p .
3  n .
4  nigricollis  (brehm , cl , 1831): nominate , is found from western europe to western asia (wintering to the south and west), in central and eastern asia , and in eastern africap .
5  n .
6  gurneyi  (roberts , 1919): is found in southern africap .
7  n .
8  californicus  (heermann , 1854): is found from southwestern canada through the western u.s.
10  it winters as far south as guatemala .
11 both common names for this species refer to features visible when the bird is in its breeding plumage; in such plumage , it has an all-black neck and a spray of golden plumes on each side of its head .
12  the name "eared grebe" was in use nearly a century before the name "black-necked grebe" .
13  the latter was first used in 1912 by ernst hartert , in an effort to bring the common name of the species in line with its scientific name .
14 [3] the genus name of this speciespodicepscomes from two latin words: podicis , meaning "vent" or "anus" and pes meaning "foot" .
15 [4] this is a reference to the attachment point of the bird's legsat the extreme back end of its body .
16  the specific epithet nigricollis is latin for "black-necked": niger means "black" and collis means "neck" .

19  nigricollis , non-breeding plumagethe black-necked grebe is 2834 centimetres (1113 in) long .
20  the adult is unmistakable in summer , with a black head and neck and yellow ear tufts .
21  in winter , this small grebe is white with a poorly defined black cap , which distinguishes it from the crisper-looking slavonian grebe (horned grebe in america) .
22 in courtship the male gives a mellow poo-ee-chk call to the female .
23 this species breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across europe , asia , africa , northern south america and the southwest and western united states .
24  the north american subspecies , p .
25  n .
26  californicus , is known as the eared grebe (or "eared diver") .
27  these birds migrate in winter , mostly to the pacific coast where they range south to el salvador on a regular basis; vagrants may occur as far as costa rica .

30  nigricollis in the cooler temperate regions of the old world also winter further south , with many european birds moving to the mediterranean area .
31  the isolated southern african race , p .
32  n .
33  gurneyi , is sedentary .
34  it was named by south african ornithologist and author austin roberts in honour of the english bankers and amateur ornithologists john henry gurney and john henry gurney jr .

36 the large breeding population in county roscommon , ireland , discovered about 1915, fell victim to a drainage scheme in the late 1930s; at its peak there were an estimated 250-300 pairs .
37  breeding , in very small numbers , was suspected in ireland in 2002, 2006, and 2011, and confirmed in 2012.behaviourthe black-necked grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver , and pursues its prey underwater , eating mostly fish as well as small crustaceans , aquatic insects and larvae .
38  it prefers to escape danger by diving rather than flying , although it can easily rise from the water .
39 like all grebes , the black-necked grebe nests on the water's edge , since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well .
40  usually two eggs are laid , and the striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back .
41 the black-necked grebe is essentially flightless for most of the year (9 to 10 months), and is one of the most inefficient fliers among avifauna .
42  generally , it avoids flying at all costs and reserves long-distance flight exclusively for migration .
43  however , when migrating , it will travel as much as 6,000 km (3,700 mi) to reach prosperous areas that are exploited by few other species .
