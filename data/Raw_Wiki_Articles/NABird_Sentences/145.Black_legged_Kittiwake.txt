0 the black-legged kittiwake (rissa tridactyla) is a seabird species in the gull family laridae .
1 this species was first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as larus tridactylus .
2 [2]in north america , this species is known as the black-legged kittiwake to differentiate it from the red-legged kittiwake , but in europe , where it is the only member of the genus , it is often known just as kittiwake .
3 descriptionthe adult is 3741 cm (1516 in) in length with a wingspan of 91105 cm (3641 in) and a body mass of 305525 g (10.818.5 oz) .
4 [3] it has a white head and body , grey back , grey wings tipped solid black , and have black legs and a yellow bill .
5  occasional individuals have pinky-grey to reddish legs , inviting confusion with red-legged kittiwake .
6  in winter , this species acquires a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar .
7  the name is derived from its call , a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake , kitte-wa-aaake' .

9  it breeds in large colonies on cliffs and is very noisy on the breeding ground .
10  cliff nesting for gulls occurs only in the rissa species , and the kittiwake is capable of utilizing the very sheerest of vertical cliffs , as is evident in their nesting sites on staple island in the outer farne islands .
11 [6] one to two buff spotted eggs are laid in the nest lined with moss or seaweed .
12  the downy young of kittiwakes are white , since they have no need of camouflage from predators , and do not wander from the nest like larus gulls for obvious safety reasons .
13 at fledging , the juveniles differ from the adults in having a black 'w' band across the length of the wings and whiter secondary and primary feathers behind the black 'w', a black hind-neck collar and a black terminal band on the tail .
14  the old fisherman's name of "tarrock" for juvenile kittiwakes is still occasionally used .
15 feedingthey are fish feeders , and are more pelagic than larus gulls outside the breeding season .
16  they do not scavenge at tips like some other gull species .
