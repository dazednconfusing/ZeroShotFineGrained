0 the common grackle (quiscalus quiscula) is a large icterid which is found in large numbers through much of north america .
1 ==description==adult common grackles measure from {convert|28|to|34|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , span {convert|36|-|46|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wings and weigh {convert|74|-|142|g|oz|abbr=on} .
2  common grackles are less sexually dimorphic than larger grackle species but the differences between the sexes can still be noticeable .
3  the male , which averages {convert|122|g|oz|abbr=on}, is larger than the female , at an average of {convert|94|g|oz|abbr=on} .
4  adults have a long , dark bill , pale yellowish eyes and a long tail; its feathers appear black with purple , green or blue iridescence on the head , and primarily bronze sheen in the body plumage .
5  the adult female , beyond being smaller , is usually less iridescent; her tail in particular is shorter , and unlike the males , does not keel (display a longitudinal ridge) in flight and is brown with no purple or blue gloss .
6  the juvenile is brown with dark brown eyes .
7 ==distribution and habitat==the breeding habitat is open and semi-open areas across north america east of the rocky mountains .
8  the nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs , usually near water; sometimes , the common grackle will nest in cavities or in man-made structures .
9  it often nests in colonies , some being quite large .
10  bird houses are also a suitable nesting site .
11  there are four to seven eggs .
12 this bird is a permanent resident in much of its range .
13  northern birds migrate in flocks to the southeastern united states .
14 ==ecology and behavior==the common grackle forages on the ground , in shallow water or in shrubs; it will steal food from other birds .
15  it is omnivorous , eating insects , minnows , frogs , eggs , berries , seeds , grain and even small birds and mice .
16  grackles at outdoor eating areas often wait eagerly until someone drops some food .
17  they will rush forward and try to grab it , often snatching food out of the beak of another bird .
18  grackles prefer to eat from the ground at bird feeders , making scattered seed an excellent choice of food for them .
19  in shopping centers , grackles can be regularly seen foraging for bugs , especially after a lawn trimming .
20 along with some other species of grackles , the common grackle is known to practice "anting", rubbing insects on its feathers possibly to apply liquids such as formic acid secreted by the insects .
21 this bird's song is particularly harsh , especially when these birds , in a flock , are calling .
22  songs vary from , year round chewink chewink to a more complex breeding season ooo whew ,whew ,whew ,whew ,whew call that gets faster and faster and ends with a loud crewhewwhew! it also occasionally sounds like a power line buzzing .
23  the grackle can also mimic the sounds of other birds or even humans , though not as precisely as the mockingbird , which is known to share its habitat in the southeastern united states .
24 in the breeding season , males tip their heads back and fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away .
25  this same behavior is used as a defensive posture to attempt to intimidate predators .
26  male common grackles are less aggressive toward one another , and more cooperative and social , than the larger boat-tailed grackle species .
27 grackles tend to congregate in large groups , popularly referred to as a plague or annoyance .
28  this enables them to detect birds invading their territory , and predators , which are mobbed en masse to deter the intruders .
29 ==relationship with humans==the range of this bird expanded west as forests were cleared .
30  in some areas , it is now considered a pest by farmers because of their large numbers and fondness for grain .
31  despite a currently robust population , a recent study by the national audubon society of data from the christmas bird count indicated that populations had declined by 61% to a population of 73 million from historic highs of over 190 million birds .
32 {citation needed|date=april 2015}unlike many birds , the grackle benefits from the expansion of human populations due to its resourceful and opportunistic nature .
33  common grackles are considered a serious threat to crops by some , and notoriously difficult to exterminate and usually require the use of hawks or similar large birds of prey .
