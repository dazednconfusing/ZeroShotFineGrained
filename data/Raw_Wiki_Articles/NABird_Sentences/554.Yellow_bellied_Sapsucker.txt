0 the yellow-bellied sapsucker (sphyrapicus varius) is a medium-sized woodpecker found in north america , central america and the caribbean .
1 ==taxonomy==the yellow-bellied sapsucker is one of four species in the genus sphyrapicus .
2  first described by carl linnaeus in 1766, it is monotypic across its sizable range .
3 ==description==the yellow-bellied sapsucker is a mid-sized woodpecker , measuring {convert|18|-|22|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , {convert|34|-|40|cm|in|abbr=on} in wingspan and weighing from {convert|40|-|63|g|oz|abbr=on} .
4  adults are black on the back and wings with white bars; they have a black head with white lines down the side and a red forehead and crown , a yellow breast and upper belly , a white lower belly and rump and a black tail with a white central bar .
5  adult males have a red throat; females have a white throat .
6 ===vocalization===they drum and give a cat-like call in spring to declare ownership of territory .
7 ===similar species===the red-naped sapsucker is distinguished by having a red nape (back of the head) .
8  the hairy woodpecker has no red on the crown (front of the head) or throat and has blacker back .
9  the downy woodpecker has same markings as the hairy woodpecker but is significantly smaller .
10 ==distribution and habitat==the breeding habitat of the yellow-bellied sapsucker is forested areas across canada , eastern alaska and the northeastern united states .
11  they prefer young , mainly deciduous forests .
12  there is also a disjunct population found in high elevations of the appalachian mountains in virginia , tennessee , and north carolina .
13 ==ecology and behavior=====diet===like other sapsuckers , these birds drill holes in trees and eat the sap and insects drawn to it .
14  they may also pick insects from tree trunks or catch them in flight .
15  they also eat fruit and berries .
16 ===reproduction===yellow-bellied sapsuckers nest in a large cavity excavated in a deciduous tree , often choosing one weakened by disease; the same site may be used for several years .
17  both the male and the female work in making the nest , where five or seven white eggs are well concealed .
18  both birds share in hatching .
19 they will mate with the same partner from year to year , as long as both birds survive .
20  they sometimes hybridize with red-naped sapsuckers or red-breasted sapsuckers where their breeding ranges overlap .
21 ===wintering and migration===these birds migrate to the southeastern united states , west indies and central america , leaving their summer range .
22  this species has occurred as a very rare vagrant to ireland and great britain .
23 ==conservation==in the united states , yellow-bellied sapsuckers are listed and protected under the migratory bird treaty act .
24  taking , killing , or possessing this species is illegal without a permit .
25 ==relationship with humans=====damage to trees===because yellow-bellied sapsuckers feed on up to 250 species of living trees and woody plants , they are sometimes considered to be a pest .
26  the birds can cause serious damage to trees , and intensive feeding has been documented as a source of tree mortality .
27  sapsucker feeding can kill a tree by girdling , which occurs when a ring of bark around the trunk is severely injured .
28  certain tree species are particularly susceptible to dying after being damaged by yellow-bellied sapsuckers .
29  for example , a usda forest study that examined trees injured by yellow-bellied sapsuckers noted a mortality of 67% for gray birch (betula populifolia), 51% for paper birch (betula papyrifera), and 40% for red maple (acer rubrum) .
30  in other tree species , injuries inflicted by yellow-bellied sapsuckers can result in significantly less mortality .
31  the usda study noted that only 3% of red spruce (picea rubens) and 1% of hemlock (tsuga canadensis) that were injured by sapsuckers succumbed to their wounds .
32 in orchards , the usda recommends allowing yellow-bellied sapsuckers to feed upon their preferred tree(s), suggesting the birds will focus their attention on these and spare the rest of the orchard from serious damage .
33  non-lethal deterrents can also be applied to trees to ward off the birds , including burlap wraps and bird tanglefoot (a type of sticky repellent) .
34  in commercial aspen plantations , yellow-bellied sapsuckers can be drawn to a stand by individual trees infested by the fungus fomes igniarius .
35  infested trees are prone to heartwood decay , which provides prime habitat for sapsuckers to carve nesting holes .
36  therefore , infested trees should be eliminated to prevent colonization of commercial aspen stands by sapsuckers .
