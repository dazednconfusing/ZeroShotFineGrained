2 the rock dove[3] or rock pigeon (columba livia) is a member of the bird family columbidae (doves and pigeons) .
3 [4]:624 in common usage , this bird is often simply referred to as the "pigeon" .
4 the species includes the domestic pigeon , including the fancy pigeon .
5  escaped domestic pigeons have given rise to populations of feral pigeons around the world .
6 [5]wild rock doves are pale grey with two black bars on each wing , while domestic and feral pigeons are very variable in colour and pattern .
7  there are few visible differences between males and females .
8 [6] the species is generally monogamous , with two squabs (young) per brood .
9  both parents care for the young for a time .
10 [7]habitats include various open and semi-open environments .
11  cliffs and rock ledges are used for roosting and breeding in the wild .
12  originally found wild in europe , north africa , and western asia , pigeons have become established in cities around the world .
13  the species is abundant , with an estimated population of 17 to 28 million feral and wild birds in europe .
14 [1]taxonomy and namingcolumba livia in indiathe rock dove was first described by gmelin in 1789.[8] the genus name columba is the latin word meaning "pigeon , dove",[9] whose older etymology comes from the ancient greek  (kolumbos), "a diver", from  (kolumbao), "dive , plunge headlong , swim" .
15 [10] aristophanes (birds , 304) and others use the word  (kolumbis), "diver", for the name of the bird , because of its swimming motion in the air .
16  the specific epithet is derived from the latin livor , "bluish" .
17 [11] its closest relative in the columba genus is the hill pigeon , followed by the other rock pigeons: the snow , speckled and white-collared pigeons .
18 [4]the species is also known as the rock pigeon or blue rock dove , the former being the official name from 2004 to 2011, at which point the ioc changed their official listing to its original british name of rock dove (styled as rock dove) .
19 [3][12] in common usage , this bird is still often simply referred to as the "pigeon" .
20  pigeon chicks are called squabs .
21 [7]subspeciesthere are 12 subspecies recognised by gibbs (2000); some of these may be derived from feral stock .

77 descriptionbright orange eyes of a pigeonthe adult of the nominate subspecies of the rock dove is 29 to 37 cm (11 to 15 in) long with a 62 to 72 cm (24 to 28 in) wingspan .
78 [13] weight for wild or feral rock doves ranges from 238380 g (8.413.4 oz), though overfed domestic and semi-domestic individuals can exceed normal weights .
79 [4][6] it has a dark bluish-grey head , neck , and chest with glossy yellowish , greenish , and reddish-purple iridescence along its neck and wing feathers .
80  the iris is orange , red or golden with a paler inner ring , and the bare skin round the eye is bluish-grey .
81  the bill is grey-black with a conspicuous off-white cere , and the feet are purplish-red .
82  among standard measurements , the wing chord is typically around 22.3 cm (8.8 in), the tail is 9.5 to 11 cm (3.7 to 4.3 in), the bill is around 1.8 cm (0.71 in) and the tarsus is 2.6 to 3.5 cm (1.0 to 1.4 in) .
83 [4]the adult female is almost identical to the male , but the iridescence on the neck is less intense and more restricted to the rear and sides , while that on the breast is often very obscure .
84 [4]the white lower back of the pure rock dove is its best identification character; the two black bars on its pale grey wings are also distinctive .
85  the tail has a black band on the end and the outer web of the tail feathers are margined with white .
86  it is strong and quick on the wing , dashing out from sea caves , flying low over the water , its lighter grey rump showing well from above .
87 [12]young birds show little lustre and are duller .
88  eye colour of the pigeon is generally orange but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes .
89  the eyelids are orange in colour and are encapsulated in a grey-white eye ring .
90  the feet are red to pink .
91 [7]in flightgroup of doveswhen circling overhead , the white underwing of the bird becomes conspicuous .
92  in its flight , behaviour , and voice , which is more of a dovecot coo than the phrase of the wood pigeon , it is a typical pigeon .
93  although it is a relatively strong flier , it also glides frequently , holding its wings in a very pronounced v shape as it does .
94  though fields are visited for grain and green food , it is often not plentiful enough as to be a viewed as pest .
95 [14]pigeons feed on the ground in flocks or individually .
96  they roost together in buildings or on walls or statues .
97  when drinking , most birds take small sips and tilt their heads backwards to swallow the water .
98  pigeons are able to dip their bills into the water and drink continuously without having to tilt their heads back .
99  when disturbed , a pigeon in a group will take off with a noisy clapping sound .
100 [15]pigeons , especially homing or carrier breeds , are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances .
101  despite these demonstrated abilities , wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas .
102 [6]distribution and habitatthe rock dove has a restricted natural resident range in western and southern europe , north africa , and into south asia .
103  the rock dove is often found in pairs in the breeding season but is usually gregarious .
104 [4] the species (including ferals) has a large range , with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2 (3,900,000 sq mi) .
105  it has a large global population , including an estimated 1728 million individuals in europe .
106 [1] fossil evidence suggests the rock dove originated in southern asia and skeletal remains unearthed in israel confirm their existence there for at least three hundred thousand years .
107 [5] however , this species has such a long history with humans that it is impossible to tell exactly where the species' original range was .
108 [6] its habitat is natural cliffs , usually on coasts .
109  its domesticated form , the feral pigeon , has been widely introduced elsewhere , and is common , especially in cities , over much of the world .
110  a rock pigeon's lifespan is anywhere from 35 years in the wild to 15 years in captivity , though longer-lived specimens have been reported .
111 [15] the main causes of mortality in the wild are predators and persecution by humans .
112 [citation needed] the species was first introduced to north america in 1606 at port royal , nova scotia .

114 oggplay mediacourtship displaythe rock dove breeds at any time of the year , but peak times are spring and summer .
115  in india , they breed in february .
116  nesting sites are along coastal cliff faces , as well as the artificial cliff faces created by apartment buildings with accessible ledges or roof spaces .
117 [16]the nest is a flimsy platform of straw and sticks , laid on a ledge , under cover , often on the window ledges of buildings .
118 [6] two white eggs are laid; incubation is shared by both parents lasting from seventeen to nineteen days .
119 [7] the newly hatched squab (nestling) has pale yellow down and a flesh-coloured bill with a dark band .
120  for the first few days , the baby squab is tended and fed (through regurgitation) exclusively on "crop milk" (also called "pigeon milk" or "pigeon's milk") .
121  the pigeon milk is produced in the crops of both parents in all species of pigeons and doves .
122  the fledging period is about 30 days .
123 [13]predatorswith only its flying abilities protecting it from predation , rock pigeons are a favourite almost around the world for a wide range of raptorial birds .
124  in fact , with feral pigeons existing in almost every city in the world , they may form the majority of prey for several raptor species who live in urban areas .
125  peregrine falcons and eurasian sparrowhawks are natural predators of pigeons that are quite adept at catching and feeding upon this species .
126  up to 80% of the diet of peregrine falcons in several cities that have breeding falcons is composed of feral pigeons .
127 [17] some common predators of feral pigeons in north america are opossums , raccoons , red-tailed hawks , great horned owls , eastern screech owls and accipiters .
128  the birds that prey on pigeons in north america can range in size from american kestrels to golden eagles and can even include gulls , crows , and ravens .
129 [18] on the ground the adults , their young and their eggs are at risk from feral and domestic cats .
130 [7] doves and pigeons are considered to be game birds as many species have been hunted and used for food in many of the countries in which they are native .
131 [19]parasitespigeons may harbour a diverse parasite fauna .
132 [20] they often host the intestinal helminths capillaria columbae and ascaridia columbae .
133  their ectoparasites include the ischnoceran lice columbicola columbae , campanulotes bidentatus compar , the amblyceran lice bonomiella columbae , hohorstiella lata , colpocephalum turbinatum , the mites tinaminyssus melloi , dermanyssus gallinae , dermoglyphus columbae , falculifer rostratus , and diplaegidia columbae .
134  the hippoboscid fly pseudolynchia canariensis is a typical blood-sucking ectoparasite of pigeons , found only in tropical and sub-tropical regions .
135 human healthpigeons have been falsely associated with the spread of human diseases .
136 [21][verification needed] contact with pigeon droppings poses a minor risk of contracting histoplasmosis , cryptococcosis , and psittacosis ,[22] and exposure to both droppings and feathers can produce bird fancier's lung .
137  pigeons are not a major concern in the spread of west nile virus; though they can contract it , they do not appear to be able to transmit it .
138 [23] pigeons are , however , at potential risk for carrying and spreading avian influenza .
139  one study has shown that adult pigeons are not clinically susceptible to the most dangerous strain of avian influenza , the h5n1, and that they did not transmit the virus to chickens .
140 [24] other studies have presented evidence of clinical signs and neurological lesions resulting from infection , but found that the pigeons did not transmit the disease to chickens reared in direct contact with them .
141 [25][26] pigeons were found to be "resistant or minimally susceptible" to other strains of avian influenza , such as the h7n7.[27]domesticationdomestic pigeonsmain article: domestic pigeonrock doves have been domesticated for several thousand years , giving rise to the domestic pigeon (columba livia domestica) .
142 [7] as well as food and pets , domesticated pigeons are used as homing pigeons .
143  they were in the past also used as carrier pigeons , and so-called war pigeons have played significant roles during wartime , with many pigeons having received bravery awards and medals for their services in saving hundreds of human lives: including , notably , the british pigeon cher ami who received the croix de guerre for her heroic actions during world war i , and the irish paddy and the american g .

146 [7] there are numerous breeds of fancy pigeons of all sizes , colours and types .
147 [28]feral pigeonmain article: feral pigeonmany domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years , and have given rise to the feral pigeon .
148  these show a variety of plumages , although some have the blue barred pattern as does the pure rock dove .
149  feral pigeons are found in large numbers in cities and towns all over the world .
150 [29] the scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds .

154  (may 2016)challengeswater is taken in by the columba livia directly by drinking water or indirectly from the food they ingest .
155  they drink water through a process called double-suction mechanism .
156 [30] the daily diet of the pigeon places many physiological challenges that it must overcome through osmoregulation .
157  protein intake for example causes an excess of toxins of amine groups when it is broken down for energy .
158 [30] to regulate this excess and secrete these unwanted toxins the columba livia must remove the amine groups as uric acid .
159  nitrogen excretion through uric acid can be considered an advantage because it does not require a lot of water and is not very soluble , but producing it takes more energy because of its complex molecular composition .
160 [30]the danger of desiccation is a major threat to animals living on land .
161  water is lost in urine and feces , but evaporation is the principal route of water loss .
162  water lost must be replaced by drinking and water in food .
163  dehydration or salt-loading decreases the filtration rate primarily by the shutting down of the nephrons , which is controlled by an antidiuretic hormone , arginine vasotocin .
164 [31] pigeons adjust their drinking rates and food intake in parallel , and when adequate water is unavailable for excretion , food intake is limited to maintain water balance .
165  as columba livia inhabit arid environments , research attributes this to their strong flying capabilities to reach the available water sources , not because of exceptional potential for water conservation .
166  columba livia kidneys , like mammalian kidneys , are capable of producing urine hyperosmotic to the plasma utilizing the processes of filtration , reabsorption and secretion , which will be discussed later and explained through the starling-landis hypothesis .
167 [31] the medullary cones function as countercurrent units that achieve the production of hyperosmotic urine .
168  hyperosmotic urine can be understood in light of the law of diffusion and osmolarity .
169 [32]organ of osmoregulationunlike a number other bird species which have the salt gland as the primary osmoregulatory organ , columba livia does not use its salt gland even though it exists .
170 [33] columba livia uses the function of their kidneys to maintain homeostatic balance of ions such as sodium and potassium while preserving water quantity in the body .
171 [34] filtration of the blood , reabsorption of ions and water , and secretion of uric acid are all components of the kidney's process .
172  the kidneys of columba livia are located in its pelvic region .
173  columba livia has two kidneys that are coupled , each having three partially separate lobes; the posterior lobe is the largest in size .
174  like mammalian kidneys , the avian kidney contains a medullary region and a cortical region .
175  peripherally located around the cortical region , the collecting ducts gather into cone-like ducts , medullary cones , which converge into the ureters .
176  there are two types of nephrons in the kidney; nephrons that are located in the cortex and do not contain the loop of henle are called loopless nephrons , the other type is called looped or mammalian nephrons .
177  looped nephrons contain the loop of henle that continue down into the medulla then enter the distal tubule drain towards the ureter .
178 [35] mammals generally have a more vascularised glomeruli than the nephrons in birds .
179  the nephrons of avian species can not produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the blood , but , the loop of henle utilises countercurrent multiplication which allows it to become hyperosmotic in the collecting duct .
180  this alternation of permeability between different sections of the ascending and descending loop allows for the elevation of the urine osmotic pressure 2.5 times above the blood osmotic pressure .
181 specialize cell types involved in osmoregulationthe integumentary system functions in osmoregulation by acting as a barrier between the extracellular compartment and the environment to regulate water gain and loss , as well as solute flux .
182  the permeability of the integument to water and solutes varies from animal to animal .
183  the excretory system is responsible for regulating water and solute levels in the body fluids .
184  pigeons can produce hyperosmotic urine but their renal system is different from other animals .
185  they do not produce concentrated urine to reduce water loss but produce a whitish part called urate .
186  it is considered as uric acid solid crystals and it is less toxic than urea .
187 [36] the wastes move from the blood of the peritubular capillaries passes through the tubule cells and into the collecting ducts and transported as urate (uric acid) .
188  urate is then transported to the cloaca and from there to the large intestine where uric acid particle and water and solutes in the urine can be reabsorbed and balanced .
189  thus this allows them to save their body water instead of excreting large volume of dilute urea .
190  cells of the proximal tubule have numerous microvilli and mitochondria which provide surface area and energy to the proximal tubule cells .
191 [37]the blood ph is regulated by the a and b types of cells located in distal tubule and collecting duct .
192  the a type cells are acid secreting cells that have a proton atpase in the apical membrane and a cl-/ hco3- exchange system in the basolateral membrane whereas , the b type cells are base secreting cells , which secrete bicarbonate into the lumen of the tubule in exchange for chloride ions .
193  the regulation of ph in blood determines whether bicarbonate is reabsorbed or secreted .
194 [36]transport mechanisms of osmoregulationthe filtrate contains lots of important substances .
195  in the proximal tubules of the columba livia kidney , substances that are needed , such as vitamins and glucose are reabsorbed into the blood .
196 [31] their kidney has a variety of ion channels involved in salt and water transport .
197  water is reabsorbed through aquaporins which are present in the lumen of proximal tubule , basolateral membrane , and blood vessel near proximal tubule .
198  water flows from the epithelial cells into the blood via osmosis .
199  since osmosis occurs , the osmolarity of the filtrate remains isotonic .
200  sodium/potassium/atpase transporter is located in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cell , which is opposite of the lumen of proximal tubule , and actively pumps sodium out of the cell into the blood .
201 special adaptationseggshell's gas exchange and water lossgas exchange across eggshells results in water loss from the egg .
202  however , the egg must retain enough water to hydrate the embryo .
203  as a result , changing temperatures and humidity can affect the eggshell's architecture .
204 [38]:2 behavioral adaptations in columba livia and other birds , such as the incubation of their eggs , can help with the effects of these changing environments .
205 [38]:2 it was found that eggshell architecture undergoes selection decoupled from behavioural effects , and that humidity may be a driving selective pressure .
206  low humidity requires enough water to keep the embryo from desiccation , and high humidity needs enough water loss to facilitate the initiation of pulmonary respiration .
207 [38]:3 the water loss from the eggshell is directly linked to the growth rate of the species .
208  the ability of the embryo to tolerate extreme water loss is due to the parental behaviour in species colonising in different environments .
209  studies have been done showing that wild habitats of columba livia and other birds have a higher rate tolerance of various humidity levels , but columba livia do prefer areas where the humidity closely matched their native breeding conditions .
210 [38]:9 the pore areas of the shells allow water to diffuse in and out of the shell , preventing the possible harming of the embryo due to the high rates of water retention .
211  if an eggshell is thinner , it can cause a decrease in pore length , and an increase in conductance and pore area .
212  a thinner eggshell can also cause a decrease in mechanical restriction of the embryo .
