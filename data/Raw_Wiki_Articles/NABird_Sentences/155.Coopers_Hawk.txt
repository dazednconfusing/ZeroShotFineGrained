0 cooper's hawk (accipiter cooperii) is a medium-sized hawk native to the north american continent and found from southern canada to northern mexico .
1  as in many birds of prey , the male is smaller than the female .
2  the birds found east of the mississippi river tend to be larger on average than the birds found to the west .
3  other common names for the cooper's hawk include: big blue darter , chicken hawk , flying cross , hen hawk , quail hawk , striker , and swift hawk .
4 taxonomycooper's hawk was first described by french naturalist charles lucien bonaparte in 1828. it is a member of the goshawk genus accipiter .
5  this bird was named after the naturalist william cooper , one of the founders of the new york lyceum of natural history (later the new york academy of sciences) in new york .
6  other common names; big blue darter , chicken hawk , hen hawk , mexican hawk , quail hawk , striker and swift hawk .

8 ogvplay mediavideo: accipiter cooperiidescriptionthe average mass of an adult male ranges from 220 to 440 g (7.8 to 15.5 oz) with a length between 35 and 46 cm (14 and 18 in) .
9  the adult male is significantly smaller than the average female , which weigh 330 to 700 g (12 to 25 oz) and measure 42 to 50 cm (17 to 20 in) long .
10  its wingspan ranges from 62 to 94 cm (24 to 37 in) .
11 [3][4] individuals living in the eastern regions , where the sexes average 349 g (12.3 oz) and 566 g (20.0 oz), tend to be larger and heavier than those in the western regions , where the respective sexes average 280 g (9.9 oz) and 440 g (16 oz) .
12 [5] cooper's hawks have short rounded wings , the wing chord measuring 21.427.8 cm (8.410.9 in) long , and a relatively long tail , 1720.5 cm (6.78.1 in) long , with dark bands , round-ended at the tip .
13 [4] as in most accipiters , the tarsus is relatively long , measuring 5.67.6 cm (2.23.0 in) long , and the bill is relatively small , with the culmen from the cere measuring only 1.52.1 cm (0.590.83 in) .
14 [4][6][7] adults have red eyes and have a black cap , with blue-gray upper parts and white underparts with fine , thin , reddish bars .
15  their tail is blue-gray on top and pale underneath , barred with black bands .
16 [3] immatures have yellow eyes and have a brown cap , with brown upper parts and pale underparts with thin black streaks mostly ending at the belly .
17  their tail is brown on top and pale underneath , barred with dark bands .
18  the eyes of this hawk , as in most predatory birds , face forward , enabling good depth perception for hunting and catching prey while flying at top speeds .
19  they have hooked bills that are well adapted for tearing flesh of prey .
20 [5] immatures are somewhat larger than a sharp-shinned hawk and smaller than a northern goshawk , though small males nearly overlap with large female sharp-shinned hawks , and large female cooper's hawks nearly overlap with small male goshawks .
21  although the coloration is generally somewhat similar between sharp-shinned hawks and cooper's hawks , cooper's appear broader-chested and larger-headed , with generally more robust features .
22  the crow-like size of cooper's hawks is sometimes distinctive from the sharp-shinned , but this can be less reliable in large female sharp-shinneds .
23  goshawks are usually more distinctive in their larger size and differing plumage markings , with the juvenile goshawk having broader , darker streaking below with more irregular patterns than the immature cooper's .
24  the cooper's hawk appears long-necked in flight and has been described by birdwatchers as looking like a "flying cross" .
25  the cooper's hawk is seen mostly flying with quick , consecutive wing beats and a short glide , though they may also soar .
26 [8][9]distribution and habitattheir breeding range extends from southern canada to northern mexico .
27  they are generally distributed more to the south than the other north american accipiters , the sharp-shinned hawk and the northern goshawk .
28  birds from most of the canadian and northern u.s.
30  range migrate in winter , and some cooper's hawks winter as far south as panama .
31 [10] the cooper's hawk occur in various types of mixed deciduous forests and open woodlands , including small woodlots , riparian woodlands in dry country , open and pinyon woodlands , and forested mountainous regions and also now nests in many cities .
32 [10] they were once thought to be averse to cities and towns , but are now fairly common urban and suburban birds .
33  the cities provide plenty of rock pigeon and mourning dove for the cooper's hawk to prey on .
34 [3] although more adapatable in habitat than the sharp-shinned hawk , studies have indicated that the species still more often than not prefers sizeable tracts of woodland for breeding and migrating to fragmented , developed areas .
35 [11]behaviorfeedingeating a finch in a backyard with feedersthese birds capture prey from cover or while flying quickly through dense vegetation , relying almost totally on surprise .
36  one study showed that this is a quite dangerous hunting style .
37  more than 300 cooper's hawk skeletons were investigated and 23% revealed healed fractures in the bones of the chest .
38 [3] cooper's hawks prey almost exclusively on small to mid-sized birds .
39  typical prey species include american robins , other thrushes , jays , woodpeckers , european starlings , quail , icterids , cuckoos , pigeons and doves .
40  birds preyed on can range in size from wood-warblers to ring-necked pheasants .
41  they may also prey upon the raptor american kestrel and other smaller raptors , including their cousin the sharp-shinned hawk .
42 [12] they have been known to rob nests and may supplement their diet with small mammals such as chipmunks , hares , mice , squirrels , and bats .
43 [3][13] even more rarely , they may prey on lizards , frogs , or snakes .
44  it normally catches its prey with its feet and kills it by repeatedly squeezing it and holding it away from its body until it dies .
45  they have also been seen drowning their prey , holding it underwater until it stops moving .
46 [3] the hawks often pluck the feathers off their prey on a post or other perch .
47  they also hunt songbirds at backyard feeders , perching nearby then swooping down and scattering the birds to single one out in flight .
48  they may pursue prey on the ground by half running and half flying .
49 [5]courtshipthe cooper's hawks are monogamous , but most do not mate for life .
50  pairs will breed once a year and raise one brood per breeding season .
51  courtship displays include stylized flights with the wings positioned in a deep arc .
52  during their flight displays the male will begin by diving toward the female .
53  a slow speed-chase follows involving the male flying around the female exposing his expanded under tail coverts to her .
54  the male raises his wings high above the back and flies in a wide arc with slow , rhythmic flapping .
55  courting usually occurs on bright , sunny days , in midmorning .
56 [5] after pairing has occurred , the males make a bowing display before beginning to build the nest .
57 [3]breedingimmature cooper's hawk in wintertheir breeding habitats are forested areas .
58  the breeding pair builds a stick nest in large trees .
59  over a two-week period the pair builds the nest .
60  the nests are piles of sticks around 70 cm (28 in) in diameter and 1543 cm (5.916.9 in) high with a cup-shaped depression in the middle that is 20 cm (8 in) across and 10 cm (4 in) deep .
61  their nests are built in pines , oaks , douglas firs , beeches , spruces , and other tree species usually on flat ground rather than on a hillside .
62  the nests typically are about 7.615.1 m (2550 ft) high off the ground , halfway up the tree , and out on a horizontal branch .
63 [3] the clutch size is usually 3 to 5 eggs .
64  the cobalt-blue eggs average about 48 mm  38 mm (1.9 in  1.5 in) and weigh about 43 g (1.5 oz) .
65  the female incubates the eggs between 30 and 36 days .
66 [5] the hatchlings are about 28 g (0.99 oz) and 9 cm (3.5 in) long and are completely covered in white down .
67 [3] they are brooded for about two weeks by the female , while her mate forages for food .
68  the fledging stage is reached at 25 to 34 days of age , though the offspring will return to the nest to be fed until they become independent around 8 weeks .
69  eggs and nestlings are preyed on , rarely , by raccoons , crows as well as other competing cooper's hawks .
70  adults rarely fall prey to larger raptors , namely red-tailed hawks , great horned owls , peregrine falcons , golden eagles , and northern goshawks .
71 [5]communicationcooper's hawks communicate using vocalizations and displays .
72  vocal is probably preferred over display , because the denseness of their habitat could prevent displays from being seen from a distance .
73  males are usually submissive to females and will listen for reassuring call notes the females make when they are willing to be approached .
74 [14] the males have a higher pitched voice than females .
75 [5]lifespancooper's hawks live as long as 12 years in the wild .
76  the oldest known cooper's hawk was 20 years and 4 months old .
77 [15]status and conservationat one time , cooper's hawks were heavily hunted in persecution for preying on poultry and were called "chicken hawks" .
78  it is now known that predation by these hawks on domestic animals borders on negligible , and they are rarely hunted these days .
79  cooper's hawks' breeding success was also reduced by the use of the pesticide ddt , but the ban of ddt ended that threat .
80 [14] since then , the adaptable cooper's hawk has thrived .
81  however , one threat facing cooper's hawks today is the degradation and loss of habitat .
82  management activities like logging may make their former habitat unsuitable for breeding .
83 [5] the cooper's hawk , as a natural predator of almost any north american bird smaller than itself , can inadvertently deplete populations of rarer , conservation-dependent species .
84  the american kestrel , whose populations have experienced considerable decrease , is one species in which the extensive predation by the recovered cooper's hawk population is a major concern .
