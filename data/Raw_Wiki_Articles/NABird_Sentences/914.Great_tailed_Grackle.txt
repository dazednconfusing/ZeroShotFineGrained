0 the great-tailed grackle or mexican grackle (quiscalus mexicanus) is a medium-sized , gregarious passerine bird native to north and south america .
1  a member of the family icteridae , it is one of ten extant species of grackle and is closely related to the boat-tailed grackle and the slender-billed grackle .
2  it is sometimes erroneously referred to as a "blackbird" in the southern united states , although blackbirds belong to the genus euphagus .
3  similarly , it is often called "cuervo" in areas of mexico owing to its glossy black plumage , although it is not a member of the genus corvus , nor even of the family corvidae .
4 ==description==great-tailed grackles are medium-sized birds (larger than starlings and smaller than crows; {convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}-{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}) with males weighing {convert|203|g|oz|abbr=on}-{convert|265|g|oz|abbr=on} and females between {convert|115|g|oz|abbr=on}-{convert|142|g|oz|abbr=on}, and both sexes have long tails .
5  males are iridescent black with a purple-blue sheen on the feathers of the head and upper body , while females are brown with darker wings and tail .
6  the morphological difference between males and females of a species is known as sexual dimorphism .
7  adults of both sexes have bright yellow eyes , while juveniles of both sexes have brown eyes and brown plumage like females (except for streaks on the breast) .
8  great-tailed grackles , particularly the adult males , have a keel-shaped tail that they can fold vertically by aligning the two halves .
9 the great-tailed grackle and boat-tailed grackle were considered the same species until genetic analyses distinguished them as two separate species .
10 ==distribution and habitat==originally from central and south america , great-tailed grackles expanded their breeding range by over 5500% by moving north into north america between 1880 and 2000, following urban and agricultural corridors .
11  their current range stretches from northwest venezuela and western colombia and ecuador in the south to minnesota in the north , to oregon , idaho , and california in the west , to louisiana in the east , with vagrants occurring as far north as southern canada .
12  their "natural" habitat for foraging is on the ground in clear areas such as pastures , wetlands and mangroves .
13 ==diet==great-tailed grackles are noted for their diverse foraging habits .
14  they extract larvae and insects from grassy areas; eat lizards , nestlings , and eggs; forage in freshly plowed land; remove parasites from cattle; and eat fruits (e .

16 , bananas , berries) and grains (e .
17 g .
18 , maize , corn on the cob by opening the husks) .
19  they turn over objects to search for food underneath , including crustaceans , insects , and worms , they hunt tadpoles and fish by wading into shallow water , and although they do not swim , they catch fish by flying close to the water's surface , and are even reported to dive a few inches into the water to retrieve a fish .
20  they are also known to pick dead insects off of the license plates of parked cars , and kill barn swallows while flying .
21 ==behavior==great-tailed grackles have an unusually large repertoire of vocalizations that are used year-round .
22  males use a wider variety of vocalization types , while females engage mostly in "chatter", however there is a report of a female performing the "territorial song" .
23  because of their loud vocalizations , great-tailed grackles are considered a pest species by some .
24 they communally roost in trees or the reeds of wetlands at night and , during the breeding season , they nest in territories using three different mating strategies: 1) territorial males defend their territory on which many females place their nests and raise young , 2) residential males live in the larger colony but do not defend a territory or have mates , and 3) transient males stay for a few days before leaving the colony to likely move onto another colony .
25  resident and transient males sire a small number of offspring through extra pair copulations with females on territories .
26  territorial males are heavier and have longer tails than non-territorial males , and both of these characteristics are associated with having more offspring .
27 ==in culture==in mexico , where it is known as the chanate or zanate , there is a legend that it has seven songs .
28  "in the creation , the zanate having no voice , stole its seven distinct songs from the wise and knowing sea turtle .
29  you can now hear the zanate's vocals as the seven passions (love , hate , fear , courage , joy , sadness , and anger) of life .
30 " mexican artisans have created icons in clay , sometimes as whistles that portray the sea turtle with the zanate perched on its back .
31 in colombia , the species is called maria mulata , and is the official bird of cartagena de indias{citation needed|date=may 2013} .
32  cartagena artist , enrique grau , had an affinity for these birds and because of his inspiration many colombian monuments and artistic works were created in honor of its intelligence , adaptability , cheerfulness , sociability and collaborative tendencies , diligence , craftiness , and ability to take advantage of adversity .
