0 the eastern kingbird (tyrannus tyrannus) is a large tyrant flycatcher native to north america .
1 adults are grey-black on the upperparts with light underparts; they have a long black tail with a white end and long pointed wings .
2  they have a red patch on their crown , seldom seen .
3  they are of average size for a kingbird , at {convert|19|-|23|cm|in|abbr = on}, {convert|33|-|38|cm|in|abbr = on} across the wings and weighing {convert|33|-|55|g|oz|abbr = on} .
4 the call is a high-pitched , buzzing and unmusical chirp , frequently compared to an electric fence .
5 their breeding habitat is open areas across north america .
6  they make a sturdy cup nest in a tree or shrub , sometimes on top of a stump or pole .
7  these birds aggressively defend their territory , even against much larger birds .
8 these birds migrate in flocks to south america .
9  there is one european record , from ireland in october 2012.they wait on an open perch and fly out to catch insects in flight , sometimes hovering to pick food off vegetation .
10  they also eat berries and fruit , mainly in their wintering areas .
11 some eastern kingbirds place their nests in the open while others hide nests very well .
12  eastern kingbirds in southern british columbia can nest in open fields; in shrubs over open water; high in tall trees and even in the tops of small stumps .
13  both male and female participate in nest defense , but females may stay on well-hidden nests longer than females with open nests who may leave nests earlier to chase away predators .
14  those pairs nesting in the open may be able to see predators coming earlier and rely on aggressive behavior to protect their young .
15 the aggressive behavior of eastern kingbirds has been shown to keep ravens and crows from finding experimental nests placed near kingbird nests .
16  similar experimental nests placed far from the kingbird nests were found far more often by crows and ravens .
17  they can also recognize and remove cowbird eggs from their nests .
18  still , blue jays , american crows , squirrels , and tree-climbing snakes are on occasion nest predators .
19  american kestrels are probable predators of adults .
