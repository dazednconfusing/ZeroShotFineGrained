0 the common nighthawk (chordeiles minor) is a medium-sized  crepuscular or nocturnal bird , whose presence and identity are best revealed by its vocalization .
1  typically dark (grey , black and brown), displaying cryptic colouration and intricate patterns , this bird  is difficult to spot with the naked eye during the day .
2  once aerial , with its buoyant but erratic flight , this bird is most conspicuous .
3  the most remarkable feature of this aerial insectivore is its small beak that belies the massiveness of its mouth .
4  some claim appearance similarities to owls .
5  with its horizontal stance and short legs , the common nighthawk does not travel frequently on the ground , instead preferring to perch horizontally , parallel to branches , on posts , on the ground or on a roof .
6  the males of this species may roost together but the bird is primarily solitary .
7  the common nighthawk shows variability in territory size .
8 this caprimulguid has a large , flattened head with large eyes; facially it lacks rictal bristles .
9  the common nighthawk has long slender wings that at rest extend beyond a notched tail .
10  there is noticeable barring on the sides and abdomen , also white wing-patches .
11 the common nighthawk measures {convert|22|to|25|cm|abbr=on} long , displays a wing span of {convert|51|to|61|cm|abbr=on} weighs {convert|55|to|98|g|abbr=on}, and has a life span of 4 to 5 years .
12 ==pseudonyms==the common nighthawk is sometimes called a "bull-bat", due to its perceived "bat-like" flight , and the "bull-like" boom made by its wings as it pulls from a dive .
13  another name is "goatsucker" (the latin for goatsucker is caprimulgus), from an archaic , erroneous idea that the birds would fly into barns at night and suck dry the teats of goats .
14 ==taxonomy==within family caprimulgidae , the subfamily chordeilinae (nighthawks) are limited to the new world and are distinguished from the subfamily caprimulginae , by the lack of rictal bristles .
15 the american ornithologists' union treated the smaller antillean nighthawk as conspecific with the common nighthawk until 1982.up until the early 19th century , the common nighthawk and the whip-poor-will were thought to be one species .
16  the latter's call was explained as the nocturnal expression of the common nighthawk .
17  alexander wilson , "the father of american ornithology", correctly made the differentiation between the two species .
18 ===subspecies===there are 9 currently recognized subspecies:===history===this species is recorded as widespread during the late pleistocene , from virginia to california and from wyoming to texas .
19 in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , because their name contained the word "hawk", they had habits of diurnal insect hunting , and they travelled in migrating flocks , they were hunted for sport and nourishment and because they were seen as predators .
20 ===field identification===the common nighthawk is distinguished from other caprimulguids by its forked tail (includes a white bar in males); its long , unbarred , pointed wings with distinctive white patches; its lack of rictal bristles , and the key identifier  their unmistakable calls .
21  these birds range from {convert|21|to|25|cm|in|abbr=on} in total length and from {convert|51|to|61|cm|in|abbr=on} in wingspan .
22  body mass can vary from {convert|55|to|98|g|oz|abbr=on} .
23  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|17.2|to|21.3|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|13|to|15.1|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|0.5|to|0.8|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|1.2|to|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on} .
24 the common nighthawk resembles both the antillean nighthawk and the lesser nighthawk and occurs at least seasonally in the entire north american range of both of these species .
25  the lesser nighthawk is a smaller bird and displays more buffy on the undertail coverts , where the common nighthawk shows white .
26  common nighthawks and antillean nighthawks exhibit entirely dark on the basal portion of the primary feathers , whereas lesser nighthawks have bands of buffy spots .
27  common and antillean nighthawks have a longer outermost primary conveying a pointier wing tip than the lesser nighthawk .
28  the common nighthawk forages higher above ground than the lesser nighthawk and has a different call .
29  the only reliable way to distinguish antillean nighthawk without disturbance is also by the differences in their calls .
30  visually , they may only be distinguished as different from the common nighthawk once in the hand .
31  subtle differences are reported to be a challenge in field identification .
32 ==habitat and distribution==the common nighthawk may be found in forests , desert , savannahs , beach and desert scrub , cities , and prairies , at elevations of sea level or below to {convert|3000|m|abbr=on} .
33  they are one of a handful of birds that are known to inhabit recently burned forests , and then dwindle in numbers as successional growth occurs over the succeeding years or decades .
34  the common nighthawk is drawn into urban built-up areas by insects .
35 the common nighthawk is the only nighthawk occurring over the majority of northern north america .
36 food availability is likely a key factor in determining which and when areas are suitable for habitation .
37  the common nighthawk is not well adapted to survive in poor conditions , specifically low food availability .
38  therefore , a constant food supply consistent with warmer temperatures is a driving force for migration and ultimately survival .
39 it is thought that the bird is not able to enter torpor , although recent evidence suggests the opposite .
40 ===migration===during migration , common nighthawks may travel {convert|2500|to|6800|km} .
41  they migrate by day or night in loose flocks; frequently numbering in the thousands , no visible leader has been observed .
42  the enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the north america's longer migrations .
43  the northbound journey commences at the end of february and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-june .
44  the southbound migration commences mid-july and reaches a close in early october .
45 while migrating , these birds have been reported travelling through middle america , florida , the west indies , cuba , the caribbean and bermuda , finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of south america , primarily argentina .
46 as aerial insectivores , the migrants will feed en route , congregating to hunt in marshes , rivers and on lakeshores .
47  in manitoba and ontario , canada , it is reported that during migration the nighthawks are seen most commonly in the late afternoon , into the evening , with a burst of sunset feeding activities .
48 additionally , it has been noted that during migration the birds may fly closer to the ground than normal; possibly foraging for insects .
49  there is speculation that feeding also occurs at higher altitudes .
50 the common nighthawk winters in southern south america , but distribution in this range is poorly known due to difficulties in distinguishing the bird from the lesser nighthawk and in differentiating between migrants and overwintering birds .
51  in some south and central american countries , a lack of study has led to restricted and incomplete records of the bird .
52  records do support wintering in ecuador , peru , bolivia , brazil , paraguay , uruguay and argentina .
53 ==moult==in the common nighthawk , all bodily plumage and rectrices are replaced in the post-juvenile moult .
54  this moult commences in september at the breeding grounds; the majority of the body plumage is replaced but wing-coverts and rectrices are not completed until januaryfebruary , once the bird arrives at the wintering grounds .
55  there is no other moult prior to the annual moult of the adult .
56  common nighthawk adults have a complete moult that occurs mostly or completely on wintering grounds and is not completed until january or february .
57 ==behavior=====vocalization===there are no differences between the calls and song of the common nighthawk .
58  the most conspicuous vocalization is a nasal peent or beernt during even flight .
59  peak vocalizations are reported 30 to 45 minutes after sunset .
60 a croaking auk auk auk is vocalized by males while in the presence of a female during courtship .
61  another courtship sound , thought to be made solely by the males , is the boom , created by air rushing through the primaries after a quick downward flex of the wings during a daytime dive .
62 in defense of their nests , the females make a rasping sound , and males clap their wings together .
63  strongly territorial males will perform dives against fledglings , females and intruders such as humans or raccoons .
64 ===feeding and diet===frequent flyers , the long-winged common nighthawk hunts on the wing for extended periods at high altitudes or in open areas .
65  crepuscular , flying insects are its preferred food source .
66  the hunt ends as dusk becomes night , and resumes when night becomes dawn .
67  nighttime feeding (in complete darkness) is rare , even on evenings with a full moon .
68  the bird displays opportunistic feeding tendencies , although it may be able to fine-tune its meal choice in the moments before capture .
69 vision is presumed to be the main detection sense; no evidence exists to support the use of echolocation .
70  the birds have been observed to converge on artificial light sources in an effort to forage for insects enticed by the light .
71  the average flight speed of common nighthawks is {convert|23.4|km/h|mph|abbr=on} .
72 ===drinking , pellet-casting and droppings===the common nighthawk was observed to drink on its winter range by flying extremely low over the surface of the water .
73 no evidence suggests this bird casts pellets .
74 the common nighthawk is recognized to discharge feces around nest and roosting positions .
75  the bird will sporadically defecate in flight .
76  the defecation is pungent .
77 ===reproduction and nesting===the common nighthawk breeds during the period of mid-march to early october .
78  it most commonly has only one brood per season , however sometimes a second brood is produced .
79  the bird is assumed to breed every year .
80  reuse of nests by females in subsequent years has been reported .
81  a monogamous pattern has also recently been confirmed .
82 courting and mate selection occur partially in flight .
83  the male dives and booms (see vocalization) in an effort to garner female attention; the female may be in flight herself or stationary on the ground .
84 copulation occurs when the pair settles on the ground together; the male with his rocking body , widespread tail wagging and bulging throat expresses guttural croaking sounds .
85  this display by the male is performed repeatedly until copulation .
86 the preferred breeding/nesting habitat is in forested regions with expansive rocky outcrops , in clearings , in burned areas or in small patches of sandy gravel .
87  the eggs are not laid in a nest , but on bare rock , gravel , or sometimes a living substrate such as lichen .
88  least popular are breeding sites in agricultural settings .
89  as displayed in the latter portion of the 20th century , urban breeding is in decline .
90  if urban breeding sites do occur , they are observed on flat gravel rooftops .
91 it is a solitary nester , putting great distances between itself and other pairs of the same species , but a nest would more commonly occur in closer proximity to other species of birds .
92 females choose the nest site and are the primary incubators of the eggs; males will incubate occasionally .
93  incubation time varies but is approximately 18 days .
94  the female will leave the nest unattended during the evening in order to feed .
95  the male will roost in a neighbouring tree (the spot he chooses changes daily); he guards the nest by diving , hissing , wing-beating or booming at the sites .
96  in the face of predation , common nighthawks do not abandon the nest easily; instead they likely rely on their cryptic colouration to camouflage themselves .
97  if a departure does occur , the females have been noted to fly away , hissing at the intruder or performing a disturbance display .
98 ===incubation , hatching and young===the eggs are elliptical , strong , and variably coloured with heavy speckling .
99  the common nighthawk lays two {convert|6||7|g|oz|abbr=on} eggs per clutch; the eggs are laid over a period of 1 to 2 days .
100  the female alone displays a brood patch .
101 the chicks may be heard peeping in the hours before they hatch .
102  once the chicks have broken out of the shells , the removal of the debris is necessary in order to avoid predators .
103  the mother may carry the eggshells to another location or consume a portion of them .
104  once hatched , the nestlings are active and have their eyes fully or half open; additionally they display a sparing cover of soft down feathers .
105  the chicks are semiprecocial .
106  by day 2, the hatchlings' bodily mass will double and they will be able to self-propel towards their mother's call .
107  the young will hiss at an intruder .
108 the young are fed by regurgitation before sunrise and after sunset .
109  the male parent assists in feeding fledglings and will also feed the female during nesting .
110  no records exist to support a parent's ability to physically carry a chick .
111 on their 18th day , the young will make their first flight; by days 2530, they are flying proficiently .
112  the young are last seen with their parents on day 30. complete development is shown between their 4550th day .
113  at day 52, the juvenile will join the flock , potentially migrating .
114  juvenile birds , in both sexes , are lighter in colour and have a smaller white wing-patch than adult common nighthawks .
115 ===predators===like other members of the caprimulgid clan , the nighthawk's ground nesting habits endanger eggs and nestlings to predation by ground carnivores , such as skunks , raccoons and opossums .
116  confirmed predation on adults is restricted to domestic cats , golden eagles and great horned owls .
117  peregrine falcons have also been confirmed to attack nighthawks as prey , although the one recorded predation attempt was unsuccessful .
118  other suspected predators are likely to attack them , such as dogs , coyotes , foxes , hawks , american kestrels , owls , crows and ravens and snakes .
119 ==status and conservation==there has been a general decline in the number of common nighthawks in north america , but some population increases also have occurred in other geographical locations .
120  the bird's large range makes individual risk thresholds in specific regions difficult to establish .
121 the common nighthawk's trait of being a ground-nesting bird makes it particularly susceptible to predators , some of which include domestic cats , ravens , snakes , dogs , coyotes , falcons and owls .
122 lack of flat roofs , pesticides , increased predation and loss of habitat are noted factors of their decline .
123  further unstudied potential causes of decline include climate change , disease , road kills , man-made towers (posing aerial hazards) and parasites .
124 the absence of flat roofs (made with gravel) in urban settings is an important cause of decline .
125  in an effort to provide managed breeding areas , gravel pads have been added in the corners of rubberized roofs; this proves acceptable , as nesting has been observed .
