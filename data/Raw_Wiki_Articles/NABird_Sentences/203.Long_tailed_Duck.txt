13 ecologytheir breeding habitat is in tundra pools and marshes , but also along sea coasts and in large mountain lakes in the north atlantic region , alaska , northern canada , northern europe , and russia .
14  the nest is located on the ground near water; it is built using vegetation and lined with down .
15  they are migratory and winter along the eastern and western coasts of north america , on the great lakes , coastal northern europe and asia , with stragglers to the black sea .
16  the most important wintering area is the baltic sea , where a total of about 4.5 million gather .
17 the long-tailed duck is gregarious , forming large flocks in winter and during migration .
18  they feed by diving for mollusks , crustaceans and some small fish .
19  although they usually feed close to the surface , they are capable of diving to depths of 60 m (200 ft) .
20 in north american english it is sometimes called oldsquaw , though this name has fallen out of favour under influence of negative connotations of the word squaw in english usage .
21  some biologists have also feared that this name would be offensive to some native american tribes involved in the conservation effort .
22 [6] the american ornithologists' union stated that "political correctness" was not sufficient to change the name , but "to conform with english usage in other parts of the world", it officially adopted the name "long-tailed duck" .
23 [7] the scientific name is derived from latin clangere , "to resound", and hyemalis , "of winter" .
24 [2]statusthe long-tailed duck is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
