0 grus minorgrus proavus==description==adults are gray overall; during breeding , their plumage is usually much worn and stained , particularly in the migratory populations , and looks nearly ochre .
1  the average weight of the larger males is {convert|4.57|kg|lb|abbr=on}, while the average weight of females is {convert|4.02|kg|lb|abbr=on}, with a range of {convert|2.7|to|6.7|kg|lb|abbr=on} across the subspecies .
2  sandhill cranes have red foreheads , white cheeks , and long , dark , pointed bills .
3  in flight , their long , dark legs trail behind , and their long necks keep straight .
4  immature birds have reddish-brown upperparts and gray underparts .
5  the sexes look alike .
6  sizes vary among the different subspecies; the average height of these birds is around {convert|80|to|122|cm|ftin|abbr=on} .
7  their wing chords are typically {convert|41.8|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}, tails are {convert|10|-|26.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the exposed culmens are {convert|6.9|-|16|cm|in|abbr=on} long , and the tarsi measure {convert|15.5|-|26.6|cm|in|abbr=on} .
8 these cranes frequently give a loud , trumpeting call that suggests a rolled "r" in the throat , and they can be heard from a long distance .
9  mated pairs of cranes engage in "unison calling" .
10  the cranes stand close together , calling in a synchronized and complex duet .
11  the female makes two calls for every one from the male .
12 sandhill cranes' large wingspans , typically {convert|1.65|to|2.29|m|ftin|abbr=on}, make them very skilled soaring birds , similar in style to hawks and eagles .
13  using thermals to obtain lift , they can stay aloft for many hours , requiring only occasional flapping of their wings and consequently expending little energy .
14  migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds , and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) they ride .
15 sandhill cranes fly south for the winter .
16  in their wintering areas , they form flocks over 10,000. one place this happens is at bosque del apache national wildlife refuge , {convert|100|miles|abbr = on} south of albuquerque , new mexico .
17  an annual sandhill crane festival is held there in november .
18 ===fossil record===sandhill cranes have one of the longest fossil histories of any extant bird .
19  a 10-million-year-old crane fossil from nebraska is said to be of this species , but this may be from a prehistoric relative or the direct ancestor of sandhill cranes and not belong in the genus grus .
20  the oldest unequivocal sandhill crane fossil is 2.5 million years old , older by half than the earliest remains of most living species of birds , primarily found from after the pliocene/pleistocene boundary some 1.8 million years ago .
21  as these ancient sandhill cranes varied as much in size as present-day birds , those pliocene fossils are sometimes described as new species .
22  grus haydeni may have been a prehistoric relative , or it may comprise material of a sandhill crane and its ancestor .
23 ===subspecies and evolution===sandhill cranes considerably vary in size (much of which is clinal) and in migratory habits .
24  a female of g .
25  c .
26  canadensis averages {convert|3.46|kg|abbr = on}, {convert|37|in|cm|abbr=on} in length and has a wingspan of {convert|1.6|m|abbr = on} .
27  a male of g .
28  c .
29  tabida averages {convert|5|kg|abbr = on}, {convert|119|cm|abbr = on} in length and has a wingspan of {convert|2.12|m|abbr = on} .
30  the southern subspecies (along with g .
31  c .
32  rowani) are intermediate , roughly according to bergmann's rule .
33 three subspecies are resident: g .
34  c .
35  pulla of the gulf coast of the u.s.
37 , g .
38  c .
39  pratensis of florida and georgia and g .
40  c .
41  nesiotes of cuba .
42  the northern populations exist as fragmented remains in the contiguous u.s.
44  and a large and contiguous population from canada to beringia .
45  these migrate to the southwestern united states and mexico .
46  these cranes are rare vagrants to china , south korea , and japan and very rare vagrants to western europe .
47 six subspecies have been recognized in recent times:the florida sandhill crane was listed as ec or easily confused to facilitate an attempted reintroduction of the whooping crane (grus americana) into florida .
48  the attempt failed , but the listing remained .
49  the current list of endangered subspecies includes only two birds , g .
50  c .
51  nesiotes and g .
52  c .
53  rowani , with g .
54  c .
55  pratensis no longer listed .
56 the canadian sandhill cranes are not distinct and were never accepted as a valid subspecies .
57  the others can be somewhat more reliably distinguished in hand by measurements and plumage details , apart from the size differences already mentioned .
58  unequivocal identification often requires location information , which is often impossible in migrating birds .
