0 the surfbird (aphriza virgata) is a small stocky wader in the family scolopacidae .
1  it is usually classified in a genus of its own .
2  it was once considered to be allied to the turnstones , but more recent data suggests it is very close genetically to the red and great knots and should be included in calidris .
3  indeed , the great knot looks very much like a larger , longer-billed , and somewhat darker surfbird .
4 this bird has a short dark bill , yellow legs and a black band at the end of the white rump .
5  in breeding plumage , it has dark streaks on the brownish head and breast with dark spots on its white underparts; the upperparts are dark with rust colouring on the wings .
6  birds in winter plumage and immature birds are mainly grey on the upperparts and breast and white on the underparts with streaking .
7  their breeding habitat is rocky tundra areas in alaska and the yukon .
8  the female lays 4 eggs in a depression on the ground lined with vegetation .
9  both parents look after the young birds , who feed themselves .
10 these birds migrate to the pacific coasts of north and south america , from southern alaska to tierra del fuego .
11 on the nesting grounds , these birds mainly eat insects and some seeds .
12  at other times of year , they eat mollusks and crustaceans found along the surf line on rocky coasts and are usually found in small flocks , often with turnstones .
13 the song is a whistled tee tee tee .
