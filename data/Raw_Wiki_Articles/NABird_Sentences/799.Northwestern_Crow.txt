0 the northwestern crow (corvus caurinus) is an all-black passerine bird of the crow genus native to the northwest of north america .
1  it is very similar to the more western forms of the widespread american crow (corvus brachyrhynchos), but it averages slightly smaller (3341 cm in length) with proportionately smaller feet and a slightly more slender bill .
2  this taxon is reliably identified by range only .
3 ==taxonomy==this species was described by spencer fullerton baird in 1858.  the american ornithologists' union considers it closely related to the american crow , and it may be conspecific .
4   hybrids with american crow have been reported but not confirmed .
5 ==description==this species' plumage is virtually identical to that of the american crow .
6   individuals may be distinguished by in-hand criteria such as smaller wing chord and tail length , shorter tarsus , and smaller bill .
7   identification percentages increase when sex of animal is known .
8  like the american crow , the sexes look the same .
9   older birds in breeding condition may be reliably sexed by in-hand criteria such as cloacal protuberance (male) or by brood patch (female) .
10  younger birds may not attain breeding condition as they assist at the nest .
11 ==distribution and habitat==this species occurs in coastal regions and offshore islands of southern alaska , south through british columbia to washington state .
12  beaches and shorelines are the principal forage areas .
13  it can often be seen in and around urban areas .
14 ==behaviour=====diet===very similar to that of the fish crow; the northwestern crow eats stranded fish , shellfish , crabs and mussels , and also searches through refuse containers for suitable food items .
15  it has been seen to fly into the air with mussels and drop them onto hard surfaces to break them open .
16  it also regularly eats insects , other invertebrates , and various fruits (especially berries) .
17  it raids other birds' nests to eat eggs and hatchlings .
18 ===predators===an incomplete list includes cats , raccoons , raptors and ravens .
19  the crows often gather in large groups to mob these predators .
20 ===nesting===generally solitary , but sometimes built in association with a few other individuals in small , loose colonies in trees or sometimes large bushes .
21  very rarely , it will nest on cliffs in a recess or even on the ground in a remote area if overhung by a rock for shelter .
22  it is a typical crow nest with 4-5 eggs usually laid .
23 ===voice===the voice is very varied , and many types of call are made , but the most common are usually described as a high pitched "caw" and the sound of a cork coming out of a bottle .
24  a "wok-wok-wok" is given by a bird in flight if straggling behind the group , and various clicks and mechanical sounding rattles are also heard .
