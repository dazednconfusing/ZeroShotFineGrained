0 the red-necked grebe (podiceps grisegena) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere .
1  its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts , although some birds may winter on large lakes .
2  grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes , marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites .
3 the red-necked grebe is a nondescript dusky-grey bird in winter .
4  during the breeding season , it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage , black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived .
5  it also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls .
6  once paired , it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog .
7 like all grebes , the red-necked is a good swimmer , a particularly swift diver , and responds to danger by diving rather than flying .
8  the feet are positioned far back on the body , near the tail , which makes the bird ungainly on land .
9  it dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers , possibly to protect the digestive system .

15 taxonomygrebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed , rather than webbed , toes .
16  there are several genera , of which the most widespread is podiceps with nine species , one recently extinct .
17  the red-necked grebe's closest relative is the fish-eating great crested grebe of europe and western asia .
18 [2] it is possible that the red-necked grebe originally evolved in north america and later spread to europe , where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin .
19 [3] fossils of the species dating to the middle pleistocene have been found in italy .
20 [4]the genus name podiceps comes from latin podicis , "vent" or "anus", and pes , "foot", and is a reference to the placement of a grebe's legs towards the rear of its body .
21 [5] the species name grisegena is from latin griseus (grey) and gena (cheek) and refers to the face pattern of the breeding adult .

26  holboelii (holboell's grebe , named for danish explorer of greenlandic birds carl peter holbll) in north america and eastern siberia .
27  the east asian birds have slightly smaller bills than the american form , although the differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies .
28 [7]descriptionthe red-necked grebe is a medium-large grebe , smaller than the great crested grebe of eurasia , and the western and clark's grebes of north america .
29 [8][9] the adult of the nominate european subspecies is 4050 cm (1620 in) long with a 7785 cm (3033 in) average wingspan ,[10] and weighs 692925 g (24.432.6 oz) .
30 [10] in breeding plumage , it has a black cap that extends below the eye , very pale grey cheeks and throat , a rusty red neck , dark grey back and flanks , and white underparts .
31  the eyes are dark brown and the long , pointed bill is black with a yellow base .
32 [11]adult of american subspecies with chickthe winter plumage of the red-necked grebe is duskier than that of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined , and merges into the grey face , and a pale crescent that curves around the rear of the face contrasts with the rest of the head .
33  the front of the neck is whitish or light grey , the hind neck is darker grey , and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer .
34 [11] although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage , it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species .
35  it is larger than the slavonian (horned) grebe , with a relatively larger bill and a grey , rather than white face .
36 [12] it is closer in size to the eurasian great crested grebe , but that species is longer-necked , has a more contrasting head pattern , and always shows white above the eye .
37 [11]the sexes are similar in appearance , although the male averages heavier than the female .
38 [10] chicks have a striped head and breast , and older juveniles have a striped face , diffuse blackish cap , pale red neck and extensive yellow on the bill .

42 [13] the plumages are the same as those of the nominate race , although the adult's bill is more extensively yellow .

46 [7]the red-necked grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind the body , which gives it a stretched-out appearance .
47 [14] the relatively small wings are grey with white secondaries , and beat very rapidly .
48 [11] its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land ,[15] and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off .
49 [16] like all grebes , the red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater , and steers by rotating its legs , since its tail is too short for this purpose .
50 [17]this is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season , but , like its relatives , it is mainly silent for the rest of the year .
51  it has a loud , wailing or howling display call uooooh , given by a single bird or a pair in duet , by night or during the day , and often from cover .
52  long sequences of up to 60 consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds .
53  a great variety of quacking , clucking , hissing , rattling and purring calls are also given , with much individual variation .
54 [10]distribution and habitata breeding adult of the nominate subspeciesbreeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes , bays of larger lakes , marshes , and other inland bodies of water , often less than 3 ha (7.4 acres) in extent and less than 2 m (6.6 ft) deep .
55  the red-necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or , further north , in shrub tundra , and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation , such as reedbeds .
56 [18] the best breeding habitat is fish-ponds , which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements .
57 [19] the american subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density , and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes .
58 [3]all populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea , usually in estuaries and bays , but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands .
59 [7] the preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than 15 m (49 ft) deep with a sand or gravel bottom , scattered rocks and patches of seaweed .
60 [18] during winter , birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks , but on migration , concentrations of over 2000 individuals may occur at favoured staging sites .
61 [18] migration is usually at night , but may occur during the day , especially when over water .
62  this is particularly noticeable in autumn on the great lakes , when up to 18,000 birds may pass whitefish point on lake superior; these are thought to be canadian breeders heading for the atlantic ocean to winter .
63  this easterly route is longer than that to the pacific , but avoids the rockies .
64 [7]the breeding range of the red-necked grebe overlaps with that of the slavonian grebe , although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both .
65  the red-necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate , and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones .
66  it is usually a lowland bird , breeding below 100 m (330 ft), although has nested at up to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) in turkey .
67 [10]the nominate subspecies breeds from southern sweden and denmark through central and eastern europe east to western siberia , and winters mainly in the north and baltic seas , with smaller numbers in the adriatic , black sea , caspian sea , mediterranean and on inland lakes .

70  holboelii breeds in north america in alaska , western and central canada , and the northern us east to minnesota; in asia it nests in eastern siberia from kamchatka south to hokkaido and west to mongolia .
71  the asian birds winter at sea from japan to the east china sea , and american breeders winter in the pacific , mainly from southern alaska to british columbia (with smaller numbers south to california), and in the atlantic from newfoundland and labrador to florida .
72  some birds remain on the great lakes if they are sufficiently ice-free .
73 [20] this species occurs as a rare winter vagrant in afghanistan , pakistan[21] and parts of northern and western india .
74 [22][23][24]behaviourbreeding and survivalred-necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than 50 m (160 ft) between neighbouring nests , although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites , where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory .
75 [18] semi-colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations , such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline .
76  such sites , safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection , have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders , down to 10 m (33 ft) .
77 [25] pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs , which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods .
78 [26] the territory is defended with various threat displays , including wing-spreading , hunching , and bill-thrusting;[12] pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive , less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating .
79 [27] breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds .
80 [10]breeding areas must have emergent vegetationthe monogamous pair forms in april or may on migration or at the breeding water , and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences .
81 [10] the elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking , a head-lowered "cat" display , parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds , and culminates in a "penguin" dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright , breast to breast .
82 [10][11][12]like all grebes , the red-necked grebe nests near water into which it can escape , since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land .
83  it often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes .
84  the nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation ,[10] in water 0.50.75 m (2030 in) deep , and with the bulk of nest below the water line .
85 [3] egg-laying mainly takes place from mid-april to may in europe ,[8] and somewhat later , from mid-may to june , in north america .
86 [3] parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night , possibly to evade nocturnal predators .
87  it is unclear whether this is for self-protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment , whatever the reason .
88 [28]chicks on a parent's backthe red-necked grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs , which average 3.4 cm (1.3 in) in breadth , 5.1 cm (2.0 in) in length , and weigh about 30.5 g (1.08 oz), of which 10% is shell .
89 [29] parents take turns to incubate the eggs for 2133 days until the precocial downy chicks hatch;[10] they immediately climb onto the parent's back , where they spend most of their time until they are 1017 days old .
90 [12][30] the young may be fed by the parents for up to 54 days after fledging ,[3] and can fly at 5070 days .
91 [30] the parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried .
92  later they care for the younger chicks for longer , and are aggressive with the older offspring .
93  this equalises the post-fledging survival of all chicks , and encourages their independence .
94 [31] the brood may be split , so that each parent feeds only some of the chicks .
95  this spreads the feeding demand equally between the parents .
96 [32]after breeding the adults moult their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless; migration commences once the flight feathers have regrown .
97 [18] the red-necked grebe is normally single-brooded , although second broods and re-nesting after a clutch has been lost may extend nesting into july or august .
98 [10]eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators , including the raccoon in north america and the carrion crow in europe .
99 [3][33] pike may take swimming chicks .
100 [34] on average , for each adult , 0.65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month , although the mortality rate for the adult is unknown .
101  red-necked grebes attempt to evade birds of prey by diving; when feeding , dives average less than 30 seconds , although escape dives are more prolonged .
102 [3]feedingchicks are fed by the parents for several weeks .
103 on the breeding grounds , the red-necked grebe feeds mainly on invertebrates including adult and larval aquatic insects , such as water beetles and dragonfly larvae , crayfish and molluscs .
104  fish (such as smelt[35]) may be important locally or seasonally , especially for the american subspecies , and crustaceans can constitute up to 20% of the grebe's diet .
105  birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed .
106 [18]aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged , and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation .
107 [10] a line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water .
108  the grebe probably opens its bill and looks down the eye-line toward its target .
109 [36] european breeders , which have to compete with the larger great crested grebe for fish , eat a greater proportion of invertebrates than the longer-billed american subspecies , although both races eat mainly fish in winter .
110 [3] birds of the nominate subspecies from the northernmost breeding populations in finland and russia , beyond the range of great crested grebe , have a longer and more slender bill than those further south , reflecting a greater proportion of fish in the diet where their main competitor is absent .
111 [37] if food is scarce , parents may desert unhatched eggs , or allow the smallest chicks to starve , although the latter strategy appears not to be particularly efficient in protecting the older chicks .
112 [38]like other grebes , the red-necked grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers , which remain in the bird's stomach .
113 [12] feathers are not only swallowed by adults , mainly during self-preening , but are often fed to the young , sometimes within a day of hatching .
114  these feathers soon decompose into a felt-like , amorphous mass .
115 [39] the function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown , although it has been suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard , indigestible material .
116 [12]statusadult and chicksthe red-necked grebe has a large range , estimated at 110 million square kilometres (0.43.8 million square miles), and a global population of 150,000370,000 individuals ,[40] with p .
117  g .
118  holboellii about twice as numerous as the nominate race .
119 [41] the population trend has not been quantified , but it is not believed to meet the thresholds for the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the iucn red list .
120  for these reasons , the species is evaluated as least concern .
121 [1]the red-necked grebe is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirds (aewa) applies .
122 [42] parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan .
123  the plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation , management of human activities , research , education , and implementation .
124 [43]the red-necked grebe was hunted by humans in northern europe in the mesolithic and paleolithic periods ,[44][45][46] but there is no evidence that there is any significant level of hunting at the present time .
125 [1][33] in north america , there are potential threats from pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) and pesticides such as ddt which cause reduced reproductive success due to egg sterility and eggshell thinning .
126  breeding areas may be threatened by the modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water-based recreational activities .
127 [18] there is no evidence to suggest that these threats could result in a significant risk to the overall population; more than 70% of north american red-necked grebes breed in canada , where the population is stable or increasing .
