0 the white-winged scoter (melanitta deglandi) is a large sea duck .
1 descriptionthe white-winged scoter is the largest of the three north american scoter species .
2  it is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill .
3  this is the largest species of scoter .
4  females range from 9501,950 g (2.094.30 lb) and 4856 cm (1922 in), averaging 1,180 g (2.60 lb) and 52.3 cm (20.6 in) .
5  she is brown with pale head patches .
6  the male ranges from 1,3602,128 g (2.9984.691 lb) and from 5360 cm (2124 in), averaging 1,380 g (3.04 lb) and 55 cm (22 in) .
7  he is all black , except for white around the eye and a white speculum .
8  this scoter's bill has a black base and a large knob .
9 white patches are visible but not conspicuous when wings are foldedthere are a number of differing characteristics of the eastern siberian race and the american race from alaska and canada to west of the hudson bay .
10  males of the american subspecies have browner flanks , dark yellow coloration of most of the bill and a less tall bill knob , approaching the velvet scoter .
11  the asian form has a very tall knob at the base of its mostly orange-yellow bill .
12  females are identical in the field .
13 the latin binomial commemorates the french zoologist dr .
14  cme-damien degland (17871856) .
15 taxonomyit was formerly considered to be conspecific with the velvet scoter , and some taxonomists still regard it as so .
16  these two species , and the surf scoter , are placed in the subgenus melanitta , distinct from the subgenus oidemia , black and common scoters .
17 distributionthe white-winged scoter breeds over the far north of asia east of the yenisey basin , and north america .
18  it winters further south in temperate zones , on the great lakes , the coasts of the northern usa and the southern coasts of canada , and asia as far south as china .
19  it forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters .
20  these are tightly packed , and the birds tend to take off together .
21 behaviorbreedingthe lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea , lakes or rivers , in woodland or tundra .
22  511 eggs are laid .
23  the pinkish eggs average 46.9 mm (1.85 in) in breadth , 68.2 mm (2.69 in) in length and 82.4 g (2.91 oz) in weight .
24  the incubation period can range from 25 to 30 days .
25  after about 21 days , neighboring females may start to behave aggressively towards other nesting females , resulting in confusion and mixing of broods .
26  by the time she is done brooding , a female may be tending to as much as 40 offspring due to the mixing from these conflicts .
27  the female will tend to her brood for up to 3 weeks and then abandon them , but the young will usually stay together from another 3 weeks .
28  flight capacity is thought to be gained at 63 to 77 days of age .
29 in freshwater , this species primarily feeds on crustaceans and insects; while in saltwater areas , it feeds on molluscs and crustaceans .
30  the favorite foods of the american (sub)species are an amphipod (hyalella azteca) in freshwater , and rock clams (protothaca staminea), atlantic razor clams (siliqua spp .
31 ), and arctic wedge clams (mesodesma arctatus) .
