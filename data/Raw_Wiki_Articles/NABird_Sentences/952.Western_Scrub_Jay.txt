0 the western scrub jay (aphelocoma californica), {ref label|etymology|a|a} is a species of scrub jay native to western north america .
1  it ranges from southern washington to central texas and central mexico .
2  it comprises three distinct subspecies groups , all of which may be separate species .
3  they are california scrub jay (coastal), woodhouse's scrub jay (interior us and northern mexico), and sumichrast's scrub jay (interior southern mexico) .
4  the western scrub jay was once lumped with the island scrub jay and the florida scrub jay; the taxon was then called , simply , the scrub jay .
5  the western scrub jay is nonmigratory and can be found in urban areas , where it can become tame and will come to bird feeders .
6  while many refer to scrub jays as "blue jays", the blue jay is a different species of bird entirely .
7  in recent years , the california scrub jay has expanded its range north into the tsawwassen region of british columbia .
8 ==description==the western scrub jay is a medium-sized bird , approximately {convert|27||31|cm|in|abbr=on} in length (including its tail), with a {convert|39|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan , and about {convert|80|g|oz|abbr=on} in weight .
9  coastal pacific birds tend to be brighter in coloration than those of the interior , but all are patterned in blue , white and gray , though none as uniform in color as the related mexican jay .
10  in general , this species has a blue head , wings , and tail , a gray-brown back , and grayish underparts .
11  the throat is whitish with a blue necklace .
12  the call is described as "harsh and scratchy" .
13 ==habitat==true to its name , the western scrub jay inhabits areas of low scrub , preferring pinon-juniper forests , oak woods , edges of mixed evergreen forests and sometimes mesquite bosques .
14  the coastal population also inhabits suburban gardens .
15  western scrub jays are very common west of the rocky mountains , and can be found in scrub-brush , boreal forests , temperate forests , coastal regions , and suburban areas .
16 ===foraging===western scrub jays usually forage in pairs , family groups , or small non-kin groups , outside of the breeding season .
17  they feed on small animals , such as frogs and lizards , eggs and young of other birds , insects , and (particularly in winter) grains , nuts , and berries .
18  they can be aggressive towards other birds , for example , they have been known to steal hoarded acorns from acorn woodpecker granary trees .
19  they will also eat fruit and vegetables growing in backyards .
20 ===food storing===western scrub jays , like many other corvids , exploit ephemeral surpluses by storing food in scattered caches within their territories .
21  they rely on highly accurate and complex memories to recover the hidden caches , often after long periods of time .
22  in the process of collecting and storing this food , they have shown an ability to plan ahead in choosing cache sites to provide adequate food volume and variety for the future .
23  western scrub jays are also able to rely on their accurate observational spatial memories to steal food from caches made by conspecifics .
24  to protect their caches from potential 'pilferers', food storing birds implement a number of strategies to reduce this risk of theft .
25  western scrub jays are also known for hoarding and burying brightly colored objects .
26 {citation needed|date=july 2008} western scrub jays have a mischievous streak , and they are not above outright theft .
27  they have been caught stealing acorns from acorn woodpecker caches and robbing seeds and pine cones from clark's nutcrackers .
28  some scrub jays steal acorns they have watched other jays hide .
29  when these birds go to hide their own acorns , they check first that no other jays are watching .
30  you might see western scrub jays standing on the back of a mule deer .
31  theyre picking off and eating ticks and other parasites .
32  the deer seem to appreciate the help , often standing still and holding up their ears to give the jays access .
33  the scrub jay even will eat peanuts off a human hand .
34 {cn|date=july 2015}===intelligence===recent research has suggested that western scrub jays , along with several other corvids , are among the most intelligent of animals .
35  the brain-to-body mass ratio of adult scrub jays rivals that of chimpanzees and cetaceans , and is dwarfed only by that of humans .
36  scrub jays are also the only non-primate or non-dolphin shown to plan ahead for the future , which was previously thought of as a uniquely human trait .
37  other studies have shown that they can remember locations of over 200 food caches , as well as the food item in each cache and its rate of decay .
38  western scrub jays also summon others to screech over the body of a dead jay , according to new research from the university of california , davis .
39  the birds' cacophonous "funerals" can last for up to half an hour .
40 ===nesting===the chicks start off fully gray .
41  the older they get , the more they turn blue .
42  on their heads , chicks tend to have a red crest that resembles a comb (mostly seen on chickens) .
43  the chick will lose its crest at day seven , just like the way the baby chickens lose their egg tooth at 57 days .
44  nests are built low in trees or bushes , {convert|1|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on} above the ground , primarily by the female , while the male guards her efforts .
45  the nests are sturdy , with an outside diameter of {convert|33|-|58|cm|in|abbr=on}, constructed on a platform of twigs with moss and dry grasses lined with fine roots and hair .
46  four to six eggs are laid from march through july , with some regional variations .
47  there are two common shell color variations: pale green with irregular , olive-colored spots or markings; and pale grayish-white to green with reddish-brown spots .
48  the female incubates the eggs for about 16 days .
49  the young leave the nest about 18 days after hatching .
50 ==life span==the life span of wild western scrub jays is approximately 9 years .
51  the oldest known western scrub jay was found in castaic , ca , in 1991 and raised in captivity .
52  "aaron" lived to be 19 years , and 8 months old .
53 ==diseases==populations are being adversely affected by the west nile virus , particularly in california's central valley .
54 ==phylogeny==the western , island , and florida scrub jay were once considered subspecies of a single "scrub jay" species .
55  they are now believed to be distinct .
56  beyond the close relationship of the "california" and island scrub jays , resolution of their evolutionary history has proven very difficult .
57 judging from mtdna nadh dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data , it appears there are two clades , namely a pacific one west and one east of the rocky mountains; the relationships of populations in the latter are not resolvable to satisfaction .
58  thus , it is fairly likely the western scrub jay is actually another two distinct species , one belonging to the pacific and another one to the eastern lineage(s); the latter's ancestors apparently gave rise to the florida scrub jay as well .
59  paleogeography of the rocky mountains range supports this scenario .
60 inland birds (woodhouse's scrub jay , woodhouseii group and sumichrast's scrub jay , sumichrasti group) differ in plumage (paler blue above , with an indistinct and usually incomplete breast band) from the coastal birds (california scrub jay , californica group) which are darker blue above with a strongly defined  but not necessarily complete  blue breast band .
61  the three groups also differ in ecology and behavior .
62  the beaks of the california and sumichrast's groups are strong and hooked at the tip , as they feed on acorns , whereas the pinyon-nut feeding woodhouse's group has a longer , slimmer and straighter bill with little or no hook .
63 each group contains a number of subspecies .
64  "sumichrast's scrub jay" stands apart from the others in its altruistic breeding behavior .
65  its remaining races are generally not quite as pale but have washed-out colors with indistinctly marked borders .
66  certainly , some gene flow among these populations occurs , but while the hybrid zone between the californica and woodhouseii groups is very limited .
67 the subspecies are:===california scrub jay , aphelocoma (californica) californica======woodhouse's scrub jay , aphelocoma (californica) woodhouseii===the name of this subspecies commemorates the american explorer and collector samuel washington woodhouse .
68 ===sumichrast's scrub jay , aphelocoma (californica) sumichrasti===the common name of this subspecies commemorates the mexican naturalist francis sumichrast .
