0 the mountain chickadee (poecile gambeli) is a small songbird , a passerine bird in the tit family paridae .
1  often , it is still placed in the genus parus with most other tits , but mtdna cytochrome b sequence data and morphology suggest that separating poecile more adequately expresses these birds' relationships .
2  the american ornithologists' union has been treating poecile as a distinct genus for some time .
3 mountain chickadees are known colloquially as cheeseburger birds , as their call sounds like they are saying "cheese-bur-ger .
4 "adults of both sexes have a black cap joining a black postocular stripe behind distinctive white eyebrows .
5  their backs and flanks are gray and they have paler gray underparts; they have a short black bill , and a black bib .
6  the typical adult wingspan is {convert|7.5|in|cm|abbr=on}, and the overall length is {convert|5|-|6|in|cm|abbr=on} .
7 common inhabitants of the mountainous regions of the western united states , their range extends from the southern yukon to california and rocky mountain states in the united states .
8  a few mountain chickadees may migrate locally up the mountains in the summer and down into the mountain foothills in the winter; but this phenomenon is not well documented .
9  in the santa fe valley of the southern rocky mountains , in new mexico , they can be found about {convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on} above town , at {convert|7300|ft|m|abbr=on}, as well at the base of the tallest mountains , tesuque and baldy at {convert|10400|ft|m|abbr=on}; that mountain base is located 25 minutes up the one mountain road from the valley .
10 they breed monogamously , producing 1 to 2 broods per year .
11  incubation by the female is 14 days .
12  the young are altricial , and stay in the nest for 21 days while being fed by both parents .
13 their primary diet is insects during the summer and breeding season; conifer seeds and other plant seeds are taken throughout the year .
14  they cling to the undersides of branches and to tree trunks , searching for food in the bark or breaking seeds open by hammering them with their beaks .
