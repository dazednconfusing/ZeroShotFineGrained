0 the taxonomy of this species has been debated .
1  at the higher level , some authors place the towhees in the family fringillidae .
2  within the group , there has been debate about whether the distinction between this species and the similar canyon towhee (melozone fuscus) should be at the specific or subspecific level .
3  the two populations are quite isolated from each other , and molecular genetics seems to have settled the matter in favour of two distinct species for the present .
4  on the other hand there seems to be little distinction between the northern and baja californian populations within m .
5  crissalis .
6 ==appearance==the california towhee's coloring is dull brown overall with light rust undertail coverts and buff or rust colored streaks at the throat .
7  there is little sexual dimorphism .
8  it is around {convert|20||25|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , and has a noticeably long tail of {convert|8.2|to|11.6|cm|in|abbr=on} .
9  its appearance suggests a large , plain sparrow .
10  males weigh from {convert|48.6|-|61.2|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average of {convert|53.9|g|oz|abbr=on}, while females weigh from {convert|46.3|-|61.2|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average of {convert|51.8|g|oz|abbr=on} .
11  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|7.9|to|10.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1.3|to|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2.3|to|2.8|cm|in|abbr=on} .
12 ==habitat==this bird's natural habitat is brush or chaparral , but it adapts well to urban parks and gardens .
13  however , its skulking habits combined with its nondescript appearance mean that it is not one of the better known garden birds even though it is regularly drawn to feeding stations .
14 nests are typically found in low branches or shrubs about {convert|0.5|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on} above ground .
15  the nest is a bulky cup made of twigs , stems , grasses , and hair .
16 ==behavior==the california towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub where it prefers a variety of seeds and some insects .
17  it is most often seen traveling or feeding singly or in pairs .
18 the call consists of a single-note sound that different people hear as seet , cheet , cheenk or peenk and the song consists of a long repeating series ended with a trill .
19 the female incubates the nest of 2 to 4 eggs alone for 11 days .
20  eggs are laid from march through september with shells that are slightly glossy and pale bluish white with some brownish flecks concentrated mostly on the larger end .
21  young leave the nest after 8 days .
