0 the black-bellied whistling duck (dendrocygna autumnalis), formerly also called black-bellied tree duck , is a whistling duck that breeds from the southernmost united states and tropical central to south-central south america .
1  in the usa , it can be found year-round in parts of southeast texas , and seasonally in southeast arizona , and louisiana's gulf coast .
2  it is a rare breeder in such disparate locations as florida , arkansas , georgia , and south carolina .
3  there is a large population of several hundred that winter each year in audubon park in uptown new orleans , louisiana .
4  since it is one of only two whistling-duck species native to north america , it is occasionally just known as the "whistling duck" in the southern usa .
5 ==description==the black-bellied whistling duck is a mid-sized waterfowl species .
6  length ranges from {convert|47|to|56|cm|in|abbr=on}, body mass from {convert|652|to|1020|g|lb|abbr=on} and wingspan ranges from {convert|76|to|94|cm|in|abbr=on} .
7  it has a long red bill , long head and longish legs , pale grey head and mostly grey-brown plumage .
8  the belly and tail are black , and the body plumage , back of the neck and cap are a rich chestnut brown .
9  the face and upper neck are grey , and they sport a thin but distinct white eye-ring .
10  the extensive white in the wings is obvious in flight , less so on the ground; it is formed by the secondary remiges while the primaries are black; the wing-coverts are brown .
11  males and females look alike; juveniles are similar but have a grey bill and less contrasting belly .
12 the wing bar is unique among living whistling ducks .
13  when on the ground , it may be hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl .
14  the fulvous whistling duck (d .
15  bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe , and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly rather than the other way around .
16  juvenile d .
17  autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (d .
18  viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides , as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct .
19 as the name implies , these are noisy birds with a clear whistling waa-chooo call .
20 ===subspecies===there are two subspecies , which intergrade in panama:==ecology==the black-bellied whistling duck is a common species that is "quite tame , even in the wild" .
21  it is highly gregarious , forming large flocks when not breeding , and is largely resident apart from local movements .
22  it usually nests in hollow trees .
23  the habitat is quiet shallow freshwater ponds , lakes , and marshes , cultivated land or reservoirs with plentiful vegetation , where this duck feeds mainly at night on seeds and other plant food .
24 ===diet===feeding often occurs nocturnally , but they can be encountered eating at any hour of the day .
25  black-bellied whistling ducks ingest a wide variety of plant material , but also consume arthropods and aquatic invertebrates when available .
26  they often feed on submerged vegetation by wading through shallow water .
27  as its latin name (autumnalis) implies , it is commonly seen gleaning recently harvested fields for leftover seeds and invertebrates brought up by the harvesters disturbing the soil .
28 ===movements===the black-bellied whistling duck is mainly non-migratory .
29  birds in the extreme northern portions of their range (arizona , louisiana , and parts of texas) move south in winter .
30  at the heart of their range , there is a tendency to travel in flocks over the winter months , though this behavior is not a true long-range migration but rather local dispersal .
31  7 adults and 8 ducklings were observed on west side of lake apopka , central florida , 7-24-15. they have been in this area for more than a year .
32  there has been a large flock noted for about two years in the river plantation area of parrish in manatee county florida .
33 ===reproduction===the black-bellied whistling duck is quite unique among ducks in their strong monogamous pair-bond .
34  its pairs often stay together for many years , a trait more often associated with geese and swans .
35  both parents share all tasks associated with the raising of young , from incubation to the rearing of ducklings .
36  the ducks , primarily cavity nesters , prefer the confines of a hollow tree , but will nest on the ground when necessary .
37  they also make use of chimneys , abandoned buildings , or nest boxes , the latter having been increasingly provided to them over recent decades , especially in southeast texas and mexico .
38  ducklings leap from nest cavities within two days of hatching , can feed themselves immediately , and stay with the parents for up to eight weeks .
39 ==status and conservation==this species is not considered to be of conservation concern by the iucn and the national audubon society; its global population is estimated at 1,100,000-2,000,000 birds .
