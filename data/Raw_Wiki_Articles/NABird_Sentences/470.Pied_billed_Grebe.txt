0 the pied-billed grebe (podilymbus podiceps) is a species of the grebe family of water birds .
1  since the atitln grebe (podilymbus gigas) has become extinct , it is the sole extant member of the genus podilymbus .
2  the pied-billed grebe is primarily found in ponds throughout the americas .
3  other names of this grebe include american dabchick , dabchick , carolina grebe , devil-diver , dive-dapper , dipper , hell-diver , pied-billed dabchick , pied-bill , thick-billed grebe , and water witch .
4 ==taxonomy and name==the pied-billed grebe was described by carl linnaeus in the 10th edition of his systema naturae in 1758 as colymbus podiceps .
5  the binomial name is derived from latin podilymbus , a contraction of podicipes ("feet at the buttocks", from podici-, "rump-" + pes , "foot")the origin of the name of the grebe orderand ancient greek kolymbos , "diver", and podiceps , "rump-headed", from podici- + new latin ceps .
6 outside its own genus , the closest relatives of the pied-billed grebe are the small grebes of the genus tachybaptus .
7 ===subspecies=====description==pied-billed grebes are small , stocky , and short-necked .
8  they are {convert|31|-|38|cm|sp=us|abbr=on} in length , with a wingspan of {convert|45|-|62|cm|abbr=on} and weigh {convert|253|-|568|g|oz|abbr=on} .
9  they are mainly brown , with a darker crown and back .
10  their brown color serves as camouflage in the marshes they live in .
11  they do not have white under their wings when flying , like other grebes .
12  their undertail is white and they have a short , blunt chicken-like bill that is a light grey color , which in summer is encircled by a broad black band (hence the name) .
13  in the summer , its throat is black .
14  there is no sexual dimorphism .
15  juveniles have black and white stripes and look more like winter adults .
16  this grebe does not have webbed feet .
17  its toes have lobes that come out of the side of each toe .
18  these lobes allow for easy paddling .
19  when flying , the feet appear behind the body due to the feet's placement in the far back of the body .
20 it may be confused with the least grebe , although that species is much smaller and has a thinner bill .
21  other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage , i .
22 e .
23  the eared grebe and horned grebe .
24  both species bare much more colorful breeding plumage , with rufous sides , golden crests along the side of the head against contrasting slaty color (also a rufous neck in the horned); while in winter , both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyes .
25 ===vocalization===its call is unique , loud and sounds like a "whooping kuk-kuk-cow-cow-cow-cowp-cowp .
26 " its call is similar to the yellow-billed cuckoo .
27 ==distribution and habitat==they are most commonly found throughout north america , central america and south america year round .
28  during the summer breeding season , they are most prevalent in central , northern and northeastern canada .
29  if they live in an area where the water freezes in the winter they will migrate .
30  migrating birds generally meet with year round birds in september and october .
31  they migrate at night .
32  most migratory birds leave in march or april .
33  they make occasional appearances in europe and hawaii .
34  in the united kingdom , pied-billed grebe visits have numbered 37 sightings as of 2007, appearing generally in october to january .
35  one bird in england bred with a little grebe , producing hybrid young .
36  it is the only grebe on record to have visited the galapagos islands .
37 pied-billed grebes are found in freshwater wetlands with emergent vegetation , such as cattails .
38  they are occasionally found in salt water .
39  when breeding they are found in emergent vegetation near open water , and in the winter they are primarily found in open water due to the lack of nests to maintain .
40  they may live near rivers , but prefer still water .
41  they may be found in higher elevations when migrating .
42  they will breed in restored and man-made wetlands .
43 pied-billed grebes live approximately 1012 years .
44 ==behaviour==pied-billed grebes rarely fly .
45  they make a slow dive frequently , especially when in danger , diving to about {convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on} or less .
46  they dive for about 30 seconds and may move to a more secluded area of the water , allowing only the head to be visible to watch the danger dissipate .
47  this frequency in diving has earned them the description of being reclusive or shy in nature .
48  it has also earned them nicknames like "hell-diver .
49 " they rarely spend time in flocks .
50  their courtship include calling and sometimes duets .
51  males will show territorial behaviour if another male is at the edge of his territory .
52  they face each other and then turn their heads and bills up .
53  then they turn away and start calling .
54  then they turn back around to look at one another .
55 ===breeding===the pied-billed grebe breeds in south-central canada , throughout the united states , central america , the caribbean , and temperate south america .
56  these grebes may lay up to two sets of eggs a year .
57  their nests sit on top of the water , their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water .
58  grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process .
59  they are incubated for around 23 days by both parents , with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period .
60  they will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it for an extended period of time .
61 young grebes may leave the nest within one day of hatching .
62  they are downy at birth .
63  yellow skin is seen between the lore and top of the head .
64  they do not swim well and stay out of the water .
65  they sleep on their parents' backs .
66  within four weeks they start swimming .
67  when alerted they will climb on the back of a parent grebe and eventually mature to dive under the water like their parents .
68  both parents share the role of raising the young  both feeding and carrying them on their backs .
69  sometimes the parents will dive underwater to get food with the chicks on their backs .
70 ===diet===pied-billed grebes feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates , and also on small fish and amphibians (frogs , tadpoles) .
71  they dive to obtain food .
72  their bills allow them to crush crustaceans , like crawfish .
73  they may also eat plants .
74  they have been shown to eat their own feathers , like other grebes , to aid in digestion (prevent injury from small bones) .
75  they will also feed their feathers to their young .
76 ===threats===they are extremely sensitive to disturbances , especially by humans .
77  while breeding , if scared , adults may abandon their nests without protecting the eggs .
78  the waves from boats can destroy the nests and their sounds easily frighten the birds .
79 ==in culture==pied-billed grebe feathers are thick and soft .
80  their feathers were formerly used as decorations on hats and earmuffs and they were hunted in the eastern united states , in the 19th-century .
81 ==status==the grebes are declining in new england .
82  the reasons are unknown .
83  the states of connecticut and new hampshire have declared the pied-billed grebe as endangered .
84  in new jersey and massachusetts , they have been declared threatened .
85  in vermont they are of "special concern .
86 " in rhode island they are locally extinct .
87 habitat loss is the grebe's biggest threat .
88  the draining , filling , and general destruction of wetlands causes a loss in their breeding habitats .
89  however , they are still common in the majority of their distribution areas .
