0 the red-headed woodpecker (melanerpes erythrocephalus) is a small or medium-sized woodpecker from temperate north america .
1  their breeding habitat is open country across southern canada and the eastern-central united states .
2  the species is listed as near threatened by the iucn .
3 the red-bellied woodpecker also has its most prominent red part of its plumage on the head , but it looks quite different in other respects .
4 taxonomythe red-headed woodpecker's distinct colors are true to the bird's name .
5 the red-headed woodpecker was one of the many species originally described by linnaeus in his 18th-century work systema naturae .
6 [2] the specific epithet is derived from the ancient greek words erythros 'red' and kephalos 'head' .
7 [3]there are three subspecies recognized:m .
8  e .
9  brodkorbim .

11  caurinusm .

13  erythrocephalusdescriptionadults are strikingly tri-colored , with a black back and tail and a red head and neck .
14  their underparts are mainly white .
15  the wings are black with white secondary remiges .
16  adult males and females are identical in plumage .
17 [4] juveniles have very similar markings , but have an all grey head .
18 [4] non-birders may often mistakenly identify red-bellied woodpeckers as red-headeds[citation needed], whose range overlaps somewhat with that of the red-headed woodpecker .
19  while red-bellied woodpeckers have some bright red on the backs of their necks and heads , red-headed woodpeckers have a much deeper red that covers their entire heads and necks , as well as a dramatically different overall plumage pattern .
20 these are mid-sized woodpeckers .
21  both sexes measure from 19 to 25 cm (7.5 to 9.8 in) in length , with a wingspan of 42.5 cm (16.7 in) .
22 [5][6] they weigh from 56 to 97 g (2.0 to 3.4 oz) with an average of 76 g (2.7 oz) .
23 [7] each wing measures 12.715 cm (5.05.9 in), the tail measures 6.68.5 cm (2.63.3 in), the bill measures 2.13 cm (0.831.18 in) and the tarsus measures 1.92.5 cm (0.750.98 in) .
24 [8] the maximum longevity in the wild is 9.9 years .
25 [7]they give a tchur-tchur call or drum on territory .
26 behaviorthese birds fly to catch insects in the air or on the ground , forage on trees or gather and store nuts .
27  they are omnivorous , eating insects , seeds , fruits , berries , nuts , and occasionally even the eggs of other birds .
28 [4] about two thirds of their diet is made up of plants .
29 [4] they nest in a cavity in a dead tree , utility pole , or a dead part of a tree that is between 2.45 and 24.5 m (8.0 and 80.4 ft) above the ground .
30 [4] they lay 4 to 7 eggs in early may which are incubated for two weeks .
31 [4] two broods can be raised in a single nesting season .
32 [4] northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range , with most having arrived on the breeding range by late april , and having left for winter quarters by late october;[9][10] southern birds are often permanent residents .
33 conservationthe red-headed woodpecker is a once common but declining bird species found in southern canada and east-central united states .
34  consistent long-term population declines have resulted in red-headed woodpecker's threatened status in canada and several states in the us .
35  this has led to an immediate need for conservation , which , so far , has been the focus of limited studies .
36  throughout most of its range it inhabits areas that have been heavily altered by humans .
37  factors suggested for red-headed woodpecker declines include: loss of overall habitat and , within habitats , standing dead wood required for nest sites ,[11] limitations of food supply ,[12] and possible nest-site competition with other cavity nesters such as european starlings or red-bellied woodpeckers .
38 [13][14] unfortunately few of these factors have been substantiated .
39 of the 600 canadian important bird areas only seven report the red-headed woodpecker in their area: cabot head , ontario on the georgian bay side of the tip of bruce peninsula; carden plain , ontario east of lake simcoe; long point peninsula and marshes , ontario along lake erie near london , ontario; point abino , ontario on lake erie near niagara falls; port franks forested dunes , ontario northeast of sarnia on lake huron; kinosota/leifur , manitoba at the northwest side of lake manitoba south of the narrows and east of riding mountain national park; and along south saskatchewan river from empress , alberta to lancer ferry in saskatchewan .
40 [15]popular culturein 1996, the united states postal service issued a 2-cent postage stamp depicting a perched red-headed woodpecker .
