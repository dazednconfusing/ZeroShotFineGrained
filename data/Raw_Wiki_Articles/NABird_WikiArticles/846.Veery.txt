Alternate names for this species include Wilson's thrush (named so after Alexander Wilson) and tawny thrush.

==Description==

This species measures {convert|16|-|19.5|cm|in|abbr=on} in length. Its mass is {convert|26|-|39|g|oz|abbr=on}, exceptionally up to {convert|54|g|oz|abbr=on}. The wingspan averages {convert|28.5|cm|in|abbr=on}. Each wing measures {convert|8.9|-|10.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill measures {convert|1.2|-|1.9|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2.7|-|3.25|cm|in|abbr=on}. The veery shows the characteristic underwing stripe of Catharus thrushes. Adults are mainly light brown on the upperparts. The underparts are white; the breast is light tawny with faint brownish spots. Veeries have pink legs and a poorly defined eye ring. Birds in the eastern portions of the species' breeding range are more cinnamon on the upperparts; western birds are more olive-brown. In the east, the veery is distinguished easily by its coloration; distinguishing western veeries from other Catharus thrushes is more difficult.

This bird has a breezy, downward-spiralling, flute-like song, often given from a low and concealed perch. The most common call is a harsh, descending vee-er, which gave the bird its name.

==Ecology==

The breeding habitat is humid deciduous forest across southern Canada and the northern United States. These birds migrate to eastern South America. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe.

They forage on the forest floor, flipping leaves to uncover insects; they may fly up to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and berries.

They make a cup nest on the ground or near the base of a shrub. This bird has been displaced in some parts of its range by the related wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Veeries are occasional hosts for the eggs of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater).
