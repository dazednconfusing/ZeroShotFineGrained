Abert's towhees are recognized by their relatively long tails, dark faces, and overall brown plumage. They are related to sparrows and juncos but are more similar to thrashers in appearance. They can be confused with California towhees, but their dark faces are distinct, and the range of these species only slightly overlaps. The Abert's towhee is the longest species in the diverse Emberizidae at {convert|21|to|25|cm|in|abbr=on} long, but its length is boasted by a relatively long tail, at {convert|10|to|12|cm|in|abbr=on} in length. Males weigh from {convert|40|-|54.1|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average of {convert|47.1|g|oz|abbr=on}, while females weigh from {convert|39.5|-|51|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average of {convert|44.8|g|oz|abbr=on}. In terms of weight, it is outbulked by several other towhee species. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is {convert|8.2|to|9.7|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1.5|to|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2.6|to|2.9|cm|in|abbr=on}.

==Habitat==

This bird is common in brushy riparian habitats in the Lower Sonoran desert zone but may require some effort to see as it prefers to stay well-hidden under bushes. Though threatened by cowbird nest parasitism and habitat loss, it has successfully colonized suburban environments in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area and may be fairly easily seen on the campus of Arizona State University. Despite its limited range, it is classified as a species of Least Concern in the IUCN Redlist, and there has been some range expansion along the Santa Cruz River as well as in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona.

==Feeding==

These birds are often seen foraging among dense brush for seeds. Like other towhees, they scratch at the ground in a manner similar to quail, and will sometimes dig up and eat grubs. They can be attracted to feeders by providing cracked corn on the ground.
