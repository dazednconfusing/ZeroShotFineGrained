==Description==

The least flycatcher is between {convert|5|and|5+3/4|in|cm} long, with a {convert|7+1/2|to|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on} spread. It typically weighs around {convert|11|g}. Adults have greyish-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have a conspicuous white eye ring, white wing bars, a small, short bill and a short tail. The breast is washed with grey and the sides of the belly with yellow. It is similar in appearance to the larger eastern wood pewee.

==Distribution and habitat==

Their breeding habitat is open deciduous or mixed woods across Canada and the northern United States. They make a cup nest on a fork in a small tree.

These birds migrate to Mexico and Central America.

==Behaviour==

They wait on an open perch low or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight (hawking), also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering (gleaning). They sometimes eat berries.

The song is a dry che-bec. The call is a sharp whit.
