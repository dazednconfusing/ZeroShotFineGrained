0 the red-naped sapsucker (sphyrapicus nuchalis) is a medium-sized north american woodpecker .
1  long thought to be a subspecies of the yellow-bellied sapsucker , it is now known to be a distinct species .
2 ==systematics==the red-naped sapsucker is one of four north american woodpeckers in the genus sphyrapicus .
3  it has no subspecies .
4  first described by spencer fullerton baird in 1858, it was initially thought to be a subspecies of the yellow-bellied sapsucker .
5  however , there are significant genetic differences between this species and the yellow-bellied sapsucker , and the american ornithologists' union recognized it as a distinct species in the seventh edition of its north american birds checklist , published in 1998. genetic analysis has shown that the red-naped sapsucker is a sister species with (and very closely related to) the red-breasted sapsucker , and that these two species form a superspecies with the yellow-bellied sapsucker .
6  all three species are known to hybridize with each other , with hybrids between red-naped and red-breasted sapsuckers proving particularly common .
7 the genus name sphyrapicus is a combination of the greek words sphura , meaning "hammer" and pikos , meaning "woodpecker" .
8  the specific name nuchalis is a modern latin word meaning "of the nape" .
9  in its common name , "red-naped" refers to the red patch on the back of the bird's head , while "sapsucker" refers to its distinctive method of feeding .
10 ==description==the red-naped sapsucker is a medium-sized woodpecker , measuring {convert|19|-|21|cm|in|abbr=on} long and weighing {convert|32|-|66|g|oz|abbr=on} .
11  adults have a black head with a red forehead , white stripes , and a red spot on the nape; they have a white lower belly and rump .
12  they have a yellow breast and upper belly .
13  they are black on the back and wings with white bars; they have a large white wing patch .
14  adult males have a red throat patch; for females , the lower part of the throat is red , the upper part white .
15 ==habitat and range==their breeding habitat is mixed forests in the rocky mountains and great basin areas of north america .
16  they nest in a cavity in a dead tree .
17  other species which nest in tree cavities reuse nests formerly used by these birds .
18  to provide habitat and foraging for woodpeckers , forest management objectives on public land include snag and live tree retention .
19  numerous studies have shown woodpeckers will readily nest in logged areas as long as some stands are left standing .
20  the drastic change in forest habitat cause by logging and tree retention drastically effects the quality of nesting sites and is detrimental to the red-naped sapsuckers habitat .
21 these birds migrate south and vacate areas at higher elevations .
22 ==behavior=====feeding===true to their name , and like other sapsuckers , they drill holes in trees and eat the sap as well as insects attracted to it .
23  they sometimes catch insects in flight; they also eat seeds and berries .
24 ===breeding===red-naped sapsuckers typically lay 37 white eggs .
25  the young are altricial , naked , and helpless .
26  the eggs are incubated for 1213 days and the young are able to fly and leave the nest after 2529 days of hatching .
27 throughout western north america , red-naped sapsucker (sphyrapicus nuchalis) nests have been described primarily in trembling aspen (populus tremuloides) with decay-softened wood .
28  heart-wood decay is reported to infect the roots of most aspens that red-naped sapsuckers choose to excavate for nesting .
29  red-naped sapsuckers typically excavate their first cavity relatively close to the ground and over subsequent years make progressively higher excavations .
30  most (68%) nest trees were live and 75% had broken tops .
31  western larch (larix occidentalis) and birch were greatly over utilized compared to their availability .
