0 the fish crow (corvus ossifragus) is a species of crow associated with wetland habitats in the eastern and southeastern united states .
1 ==taxonomy==the fish crow was first described by alexander wilson in 1812. the latest genetic testing now seems to indicate this species is close to the sinaloan crow (c .
2  sinaloae) and the tamaulipas crow (c .
3  imparatus), and not as close to the american crow (c .
4  brachyrhynchos) as outward signs would suggest .
5 {citation needed|date=august 2011}==description==the fish crow is superficially similar to the american crow , but is smaller (3641 cm in length) and has a more silky smooth plumage by comparison .
6  the upperparts have a blue or blue-green sheen , while the underparts have a more greenish tint to the black .
7  the eyes are dark brown .
8  the differences are often only really apparent between the two species when seen side by side or when heard calling .
9  the bill is usually somewhat slimmer than the american crow , but is only readily distinguishable if both species are seen together .
10 visual differentiation from the american crow is extremely difficult and often inaccurate .
11  nonetheless , differences apart from size do exist .
12  fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet .
13  there may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill .
14  fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking .
15  more dramatically , when calling , fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers .
16 the voice is the most outwardly differing characteristic for this species and other american crow species .
17  the call of the fish crow has been described as a nasal "ark-ark-ark" or a begging "waw-waw" .
18  birders often distinguish the two species (in areas where their range overlaps) with the mnemonic aid "just ask him if he is an american crow .
19  if he says "no", he is a fish crow .
20 " referring to the fact that the most common call of the american crow is a distinct "caw caw", while that of the fish crow is a nasal "nyuh unh" .
21 ==distribution and habitat==this species occurs on the eastern seaboard of the united states from  rhode island south to key west , and west along the northern coastline of the gulf of mexico and follows many river systems inland for quite some distance .
22  coastal marshes and beaches , rivers , inland lakes and marshes , river banks , and the land immediately surrounding all are frequented .
23 ==behavior=====diet===food is taken mainly from the ground and even in shallow water where the bird hovers and plucks food items out of the water with its feet .
24  the fish crow is omnivorous .
25  it feeds on small crustaceans , such as crabs and shrimps , other invertebrates , stranded fish , and live fish if the situation favors their capture , eggs and nestlings of birds , small reptiles , the fruits of many trees , peanuts , and grains , as well as human scraps where available .
26 ===breeding===the nest is usually built high in a tree and is often accompanied in nearby trees with other nests of the same species forming small , loose colonies .
27  usually , four or five eggs are laid .
28  pale blue-green in colour , they bear blotches of olive-brown .
29 ==conservation==this species appears to be somewhat more resistant to west nile virus than the american crow .
30  survival rates of up to 45% have been reported for fish crows , compared with near zero for the american species .
