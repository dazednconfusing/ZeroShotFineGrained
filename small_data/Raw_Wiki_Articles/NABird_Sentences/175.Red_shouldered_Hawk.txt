0 the red-shouldered hawk (buteo lineatus) is a medium-sized hawk .
1  its breeding range spans eastern north america and along the coast of california and northern to northeastern-central mexico .
2  red-shouldered hawks are permanent residents throughout most of their range , though northern birds do migrate , mostly to central mexico .
3  the main conservation threat to the widespread species is deforestation .
4 descriptionmales are 38 to 58 cm (15 to 23 in) long and weigh on average 550 g (1.21 lb) .
5  females are slightly larger at 47 to 61 cm (19 to 24 in) in length and a mean weight of 700 g (1.5 lb) .
6  the wingspan can range from 90 to 127 cm (35 to 50 in) .
7 [2][3][4][5] adult birds can vary in mass from 460 to 930 g (1.01 to 2.05 lb) .
8  among standard measurements , the wing bone is 2835 cm (1114 in) long , the tail is 1624 cm (6.39.4 in) long and the tarsus is 7.59 cm (3.03.5 in) .
9 [6] adults have brownish heads , reddish chests , and pale bellies with reddish bars .
10  their tails , which are quite long by buteo standards , are marked with narrow white bars .
11  red "shoulders" are visible when the birds are perched .
12  these hawks' upper parts are dark with pale spots and they have long yellow legs .
13  western birds may appear more red , while florida birds are generally paler .
14  the wings of adults are more heavily barred on the upper side .
15  juvenile red-shouldered hawks are most likely to be confused with juvenile broad-winged hawks , but can be distinguished by their long tails , crescent-like wing markings , and a more flapping , accipiter-like flight style .
16  in direct comparison , it is typically larger and longer proportioned than the broad-wing , though is slightly smaller and more slender than most other common north american buteos .
17  this bird is sometimes also confused with the widespread red-tailed hawk .
18  that species is larger and bulkier , with more even-sized , broad wings and is paler underneath , with a reddish tail often apparent .
19  the red-tail is also more likely to soar steadily , with wings in a slight dihedral .
20 taxonomythe red-shouldered hawk is a member of the genus buteo , a group of medium-sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings .
21  members of this genus are known as buzzards in europe , but hawks in north america .

50 [9]in the east , individuals from the northern half of the species range are migratory .
51  in the west , most populations are sedentary .
52  red-shouldered hawks are short- to moderate-distance migrants , with most individuals traveling distances between 300 km and 1,500 km each way .
53  the species follows leading lines , migrating along inland ridges and coastlines .
54  larger numbers of red-shouldered hawks are counted at coastal watchsites than at inland sites .
55  juveniles often precede adults on migration in autumn , whereas adults precede juveniles in the spring .
56  red-shouldered hawks typically migrate alone , although they sometimes form small flocks of three or more birds .
57  the species usually avoids crossing large bodies of water .
58  while migrating , red-shouldered hawks are observed in soaring , gliding , and flapping flight [10]red-shouldered hawks are forest raptors .
59  in the east , they live in bottomland hardwood stands , flooded deciduous swamps , and upland mixed deciduousconifer forests .
60  they tend to live in stands with an open subcanopy , which makes it easier for them to hunt .
61  they are not exclusively birds of deep forest , though; one can find red-shouldered hawks in some suburban areas where houses or other buildings are mixed into woodlands .
62  in the west , they live in riparian and oak woodlands , and also in eucalyptus groves and some residential areas .
63 [11]behaviorred-shouldered hawks search for prey while perched on a treetop or soaring over woodlands .
64  when they sight prey , they kill it by dropping directly onto it from the air .
65  they may cache food near their nest for later consumption .
66 [12] when in clearings , they sometimes fly low to surprise prey .
67  red-shouldered hawks , like most raptors , have very sharp vision and reasonably good hearing , with talons capable of killing animals at least equal to their own size .
68  small mammals are typically the most important prey , especially rodents .
69  voles , gophers , mice , moles and chipmunks may locally be favored based on abundance .
70  slightly larger mammals , such as rabbits and tree squirrels , are also occasionally predated .
71  other prey can include amphibians , reptiles (especially small snakes), small birds , and large insects .
72  they will attack birds as large as pigeons .
73  blue jays , a potential prey species , sometimes habitually imitate the call of the red-shouldered hawk and are known to be difficult to distinguish on voice alone .
74 [13] during winters , red-shouldered hawks sometimes habituate to preying on birds commonly found at bird feeders .
75  in some areas where they are common , crayfish can be important prey for this species .
76  unusual food items recorded for the species have included nocturnal animals such as eastern screech owls and flying squirrels and road-killed deer .
77 [14]reproductionthe breeding habitats of the red-shouldered hawk are deciduous and mixed wooded areas , often near water .
78  they have been known to nest near residential areas and open water but this is much less common .
79 [15] red-shouldered hawks select sites with greater tree species richness for nesting .
80 [16] like almost all raptors , the red-shouldered hawk is monogamous and territorial .
81  while courting or defending territories , the distinctive , screaming kee-aah call (usually repeated three to four times) of this bird is heard .
82  courtship displays occur on the breeding grounds , and involve soaring together in broad circles while calling , or soaring and diving toward one another .
83  males may also perform the "sky-dance" by soaring high in the air , and then making a series of steep dives , each followed by a wide spiral and rapid ascent .
84  these courtship flights usually occur in late morning and early afternoon .
85 red-shouldered hawks' mating season is between april and july , with activity usually peaking between april and mid-june .
86  the breeding pair builds a stick nest (also sometimes including shredded bark , leaves and green sprigs) in a major fork of a large tree .
87  they often use the same nest year after year , refurbishing it annually with sticks in the spring .
88  the clutch size is typically three to four eggs .
89  the blotchy-marked eggs , often brown to lavender in color , measure on average 54.5 mm  43 mm (2.15 in  1.69 in) .
90  the incubation period can range from 28 to 33 days .
91  hatching is asynchronous , with the first chick hatching up to a week before the last .
92  the hatchlings , which weigh 35 g (1.2 oz) at first , are brooded almost constantly by the female for up to 40 days .
93  pairs that nest earlier in the breeding season tend to lay greater numbers of eggs and have higher productivity from those eggs .
94 [17] the male more often captures food but will also incubate and brood occasionally .
95  the young leave the nest at about six weeks of age , but remain dependent on the parents until they are 17 to 19 weeks old .
96  they may continue to roost near the nest site until the following breeding season .
97  breeding maturity is usually attained at 1 or 2 years of age .
98 although they have lived as long as within a month of 20 years old , few live half that long and only around half survive their first year .
99  each year overall nesting success can be lower than 30 percent .
100 [18] early mortality can be due to natural causes , relating to harsh weather conditions , or more often starvation .
101  young hawks are often parasitized by species such as trichomonas gallinae , protocalliphora avium , and blood parasites .
102 [19] humans , unintentionally or intentionally are a threat to red-shouldered hawks , including hunting , collision with electric wires , road accidents and logging .
103  a further common cause of mortality is natural predation .
104  raccoons , martens , fishers and large arboreal snakes can predate eggs , hatchlings , fledgings and occasionally incubating and brooding adults .
105  non-nesting adults , being a fairly large and powerful predator , have fewer natural predators , but (both during and after the breeding season as well among nestling hawks) they may be predated by great horned owls , red-tailed hawks , barred owls , other red-shouldered hawks , northern goshawks , peregrine falcons , prairie falcons , and bald and golden eagles .
106  in western new york , the main cause of nest failure was stated to be great horned owl predation .
107 [20] many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species .
108  despite their highly similar diet and habitat preferences , it has been found that red-shouldered hawks can nest within 48 m (157 ft) barred owl without interspecies conflict .
109 [21] in florida , red-shouldered hawks sometimes collaborate and peaceably coexist with american crows (usually an enemy to all other birds because of their egg-hunting habits) so they cooperatively mob mutual predators , mainly great horned owls and red-tailed hawks .
110 [22]statusprior to 1900, the red-shouldered hawk was one of the most common north american raptors .
111  population densities have decreased precipitously due to the clearing of mature forests (principally the wet hardwood forest they prefer) since that time .
112  the changing of habitats has led to a general population increase of the red-tailed hawk , an occasional predator of its cousin .
113  additionally affecting the red-shouldered hawk was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s , leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century .
114  local forest regrowth and the ban of hunting has allowed red-shouldered hawk populations to become more stable again and the species is not currently considered conservation dependent .
115  in florida , the red-shouldered hawk is perhaps the most commonly seen and heard raptor species .
116 [23] however , human activity , including logging , poisoning from insecticides and industrial pollutants , continue to loom as threats to the species .
117 before its use was outlawed in the united states , red-shouldered hawks and other raptors suffered from exposure to ddt , a pesticide .
118  the ddt would cause their eggs to have thin , breakable shells , reducing their ability to reproduce .
119  accidental encounters with power lines and automobiles also take a toll on hawks .
120  in spite of these dangers , habitat loss remains the biggest threat to red-shouldered hawks .
