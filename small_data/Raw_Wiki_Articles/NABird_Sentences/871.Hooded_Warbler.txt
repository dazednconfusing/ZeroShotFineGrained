2  citrina {leftlegend|#ffff00|breeding range|outline=gray}{leftlegend|#0000ff|wintering range|outline=gray} }}the hooded warbler (setophaga citrina) is a new world warbler .
3  it breeds in eastern north america and across the eastern united states and into southernmost canada , (ontario) .
4  it is migratory , wintering in central america and the west indies .
5  hooded warblers are very rare vagrants to western europe .
6 recent genetic research has however suggested that the type species of wilsonia (hooded warbler w .
7  citrina) and of setophaga (american redstart s .
8  ruticilla) are closely related and should be merged into the same genus .
9  as the name setophaga (published in 1827) takes priority over wilsonia (published in 1838), hooded warbler would then be transferred as setophaga citrina .
10  this change has been accepted by the north american classification committee of the american ornithologists' union , and the ioc world bird list .
11  the south american classification committee continues to list the bird in the genus wilsonia .
12 ==description==the hooded warbler is a small bird and mid-sized warbler , measuring {convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and weighing {convert|9|-|12|g|oz|abbr=on} .
13  it has a plain olive/green-brown back , and yellow underparts .
14  their outer rectrices have whitish vanes .
15  males have distinctive black hoods which surround their yellow faces; the female has an olive-green cap which does not extend to the forehead , ears and throat instead .
16  males attain their hood at about 912 months of age; younger birds are essentially identical to (and easily confused with) females .
17  the song is a series of musical notes which sound like: wheeta wheeta whee-tee-oh , for which a common mnemonic is "the red , the red t-shirt" or "come to the woods or you won't see me" .
18  the call of these birds is a loud chip .
19 ==life history==these birds feed on insects , which are often found in low vegetation or caught by flycatching .
20  hooded warblers' breeding habitats are broadleaved woodlands with dense undergrowth .
21  these birds nest in low areas of a bush , laying three to five eggs in a cup-shaped nest .
22  hooded warblers are often the victims of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird , especially where the hooded warblers' forest habitats are fragmented .
23  in areas with protected woodlands or recovering wooded habitat , the hooded warbler population is stable and possibly increasing .
