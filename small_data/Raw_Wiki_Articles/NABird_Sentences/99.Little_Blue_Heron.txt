0 the little blue heron (egretta caerulea) is a small heron .
1  it breeds in the gulf states of the us , through central america and the caribbean south to peru and uruguay .
2  it is a resident breeder in most of its range , but some northern breeders migrate to the southeastern us or beyond in winter .
3  there is post-breeding dispersal to well north of the nesting range , as far as the canadaus border .
4 descriptionjuvenile , tobagothis species is about 60 cm (24 in) long , with a 102 cm (40 in) wingspan , and weighs 325 g (11.5 oz) .
5  it is a medium-large , long-legged heron with a long pointed blue or greyish bill with a black tip .
6  breeding adult birds have blue-grey plumage except for the head and neck , which are purplish and have long blue filamentous plumes .
7  the legs and feet are dark blue .
8  the sexes are similar .
9  non-breeding adults have dark blue head and neck plumage and paler legs .
10  young birds are all white except for dark wing tips and have dull greenish legs .
11  they gradually acquire blue plumage as they mature .
12 ecologythe little blue heron's breeding habitat is sub-tropical swamps .
13  it nests in colonies , often with other herons , usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs .
14  three to seven light blue eggs are laid .
15  the little blue heron stalks its prey methodically in shallow water , often running as it does so .
16  it eats fish , frogs , crustaceans , small rodents and insects .
17 white little blue herons often mingle with snowy egrets .
18  the snowy egret tolerates their presence more than little blue herons in adult plumage .
19  these young birds actually catch more fish when in the presence of the snowy egret and also gain a measure of protection from predators when they mix into flocks of white herons .
20  it is plausible that because of these advantages , they remain white for their first year .
