0 the black rosy finch , or black rosy-finch , (leucosticte atrata) is a species of passerine bird in the family fringillidae native to alpine areas above treeline , of the western united states .
1 ==taxonomy==the black rosy finch was first classified by american ornithologist robert ridgway in 1874.{r|iucn} this bird has been thought to form a superspecies with the three other rosy finches: gray-crowned rosy finch (l .
2  tephrocotis) and the brown-capped rosy finch (l .
3  australis), all of which were classified as the same species as the asian rosy finch (l .
4  arctoa) from 1983-1993.{r|alllife}{r|bna}{r|azfo} recent mitochondrial dna evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another .
5 {r|bna}{r|mtfg} along with four asian rosy finches , the three north american rosy finches form the mountain finch genus leucosticte .
6  there are no recognized subspecies of the black rosy finch .
7 {r|azfo} alternative common names include: roselin (in french), ruschneegimpel (in german), and pinzn montano negro (in spanish) .
8 {r|ibc}==description==adults are black on the head , back and breast with pink on the belly , rump and wings .
9  there is a patch of grey at the back of the head .
10  they have short black legs and a long forked tail .
11 {r|ottaviani}{r|allid} the gray-crowned rosy finch has a brown body instead of black and the brown-capped rosy finch and lacks the gray patch on the back of the head .
12 {r|allid}==distribution and habitat==the black rosy finch's breeding habitat is mountain areas above the tree-line , amongst alpine rocks and cliffs .
13  because of this it is one of the least studied birds in north america .
14 {r|bna} its distribution range is between that of the gray-crowned rosy finch (l .
15  tephrocotis), which is located to north and west , and the brown-capped rosy finch (l .
16  australis), which is located to the south and east .
17 {r|bna}==behavior==the black rosy finch builds a cup nest in a cavity on a cliff .
18  most birds migrate short distances to lower elevations and further south and return to the alpine areas in april .
19 {r|bna} these birds forage on the ground , may fly to catch insects in flight .
20  they mainly eat seeds from weeds and grasses and insects ,{r|alllife} often in areas where snow is melting , uncovering food items and new plant shoots are growing .
21 {r|bna} they often feed in small flocks , sometimes mixing with gray-crowned rosy finches .
22 {r|ottaviani} a male will defend its female's territory during breeding season , not just the nest but where ever she goes .
23  this behavior is common with the rosy finches .
24 {r|alllife}{r|mtfg1} when breeding both males and females develop throat pouches , known as gular pouches or gular skin , to carry food to their chicks ,{r|birdweb}{r|gular} a trait seen in only one other north american genus , pinicola .
25 {r|bna} due to their inaccessibility , actual black rosy finch nests had been reached by only three researchers as of 2002.{r|mtfg} the nests are made of grass and stems and lined with fine grass , hair , and feathers .
26  they are known to use protected areas such as openings in cliffs , mine shafts , caves , and rafters .
27  they eat seeds and insects , usually foraged from the ground , including snowfields .
28 {r|alllife}  their call is a buzz-sounding "chew" .
