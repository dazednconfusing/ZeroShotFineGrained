11  it also occurs on the siberian side of the bering straits east of the yana river .
12  it winters farther south in temperate zones , on the coasts of the northern usa and canada , on the pacific coast south to the san francisco bay region and on the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts , and in asia as far south as china.26some birds may over-winter on the great lakes .
13  this species is a very rare vagrant to western europe; only drakes are safely identifiable out of range , so females are likely to be undetected .
14 ecologythis species dives for crustaceans and molluscs while migrating or wintering on the sea-coasts , and feeds on insects and their larvae , especially caddisflies , fish eggs and , more rarely , vegetation such as duck weed while nesting on freshwater .
15  it forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters in winter quarters .
16  these are tightly packed , and the birds tend to take off together; in the breeding season they are less social .
17  it has been suggested that in coastal waters this species prefers sheltered embayments , and possibly waters that include some mixed depths.7the lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea , lakes or rivers , in woodland or tundra .
18  57 eggs are laid .
19  each eggs weighs from 6074 g (2.12.6 oz), or 8% of the females body weight .
20  the incubation period may range from 27 to 31 days .
21  females brood their young extensively for about 3 weeks , after which the still flightless young must fend for themselves .
