0 the great cormorant (phalacrocorax carbo), known as the great black cormorant across the northern hemisphere , the black cormorant in australia , the large cormorant in india and the black shag further south in new zealand , is a widespread member of the cormorant family of seabirds .
1 [2] the genus name is latinised ancient greek , from  (phalakros , "bald") and  (korax , "raven"), and carbo is latin for "charcoal" .
2 [3]it breeds in much of the old world and the atlantic coast of north america .
3 descriptionthe great cormorant is a large black bird , but there is a wide variation in size in the species wide range .
4  weight is reported to vary from 1.5 kg (3.3 lb)[4] to 5.3 kg (12 lb) .
5 [5] males are typically larger and heavier than females , with the nominate race (p .
6  c .
7  carbo) averaging about 10% larger in linear measurements than the smallest race in europe (p .
8  c .
9  sinensis) .
10 [6] the lightest average weights cited are in germany (p .
11  c .
12  sinensis), where 36 males averaged 2.28 kg (5.0 lb) and 17 females averaged 1.94 kg (4.3 lb) .
13 [7] the highest come from prince edward island in canada (p .
14  c .
15  carbo), where 11 males averaged 3.68 kg (8.1 lb) and 11 females averaged 2.94 kg (6.5 lb) .
16 [8][9] length can vary from 70 to 102 cm (28 to 40 in) and wingspan from 121 to 160 cm (48 to 63 in) .
17 [9][10] they are tied as the second largest extant species of cormorant after the flightless cormorant , with the japanese cormorant averaging at a similar size .
18  in bulk if not in linear dimensions , the blue-eyed shag species complex of the southern oceans are scarcely smaller at average .
19 [7] it has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch .
20  adults have white patches on the thighs and on the throat in the breeding season .
21  in european waters it can be distinguished from the common shag by its larger size , heavier build , thicker bill , lack of a crest and plumage without any green tinge .
22  in eastern north america , it is similarly larger and bulkier than double-crested cormorant , and the latter species has more yellow on the throat and bill and lack the white thigh patches frequently seen on great cormorants .
23  great cormorants are mostly silent , but they make various guttural noises at their breeding colonies .
24 variationsa very rare variation of the great cormorant is caused by albinism .
25  the phalacrocorax carbo albino suffers from loss of eyesight and/or hearing , thus it rarely manages to survive in the wild .
26 [citation needed]distributionthis is a very common and widespread bird species .
27  it feeds on the sea , in estuaries , and on freshwater lakes and rivers .
28  northern birds migrate south and winter along any coast that is well-supplied with fish .
29 the type subspecies , p .

31  carbo , is found mainly in atlantic waters and nearby inland areas: on western european coasts and south to north africa , the faroe islands , iceland and greenland; and on the eastern seaboard of north america , though in america it breeds only in the north of its range , in the canadian maritime provinces .
32 the subspecies found in australasian waters , p .

34  novaehollandiae , has a crest .
35  in new zealand , it is known as the black shag or by its mori name; kawau .
36 [11] the syntype is in the collection of the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa .

54 behaviourcormorant swallowing a just caught eelthe great cormorant breeds mainly on coasts , nesting on cliffs or in trees (which are eventually killed by the droppings), but also increasingly inland .
55  three or four eggs are laid in a nest of seaweed or twigs .
56 the great cormorant can dive to considerable depths , but often feeds in shallow water .
57  it frequently brings prey to the surface .
58  a wide variety of fish are taken: cormorants are often noticed eating eels , but this may reflect the considerable time taken to subdue an eel and position it for swallowing , rather than any dominance of eels in the diet .
59  in british waters , dive times of 2030 seconds are common , with a recovery time on the surface around a third of the dive time .
60 relationships with humansmany fishermen see in the great cormorant a competitor for fish .
61  because of this it was hunted nearly to extinction in the past .
62  thanks to conservation efforts its numbers increased .
63  at the moment there are about 1.2 million birds in europe (based on winter counts; late summer counts would show higher numbers) .
64 [13] increasing populations have once again brought the cormorant into conflict with fisheries .
65 [14][15] for example , in britain , where inland breeding was once uncommon , there are now increasing numbers of birds breeding inland , and many inland fish farms and fisheries now claim to be suffering high losses due to these birds .
66  in the uk each year some licences are issued to cull specified numbers of cormorants in order to help reduce predation , it is however still illegal to kill a bird without such a licence .
67 cormorant fishing is practised in china , japan , and elsewhere around the globe .
68  in it , fishermen tie a line around the throats of cormorants , tight enough to prevent swallowing , and deploy them from small boats .
69  the cormorants catch fish without being able to fully swallow them , and the fishermen are able to retrieve the fish simply by forcing open the cormorants' mouths , apparently engaging the regurgitation reflex .
70 in norway , cormorant is a traditional game bird .
71  each year c .
72  10,000 cormorants are shot to be eaten .
73 [16] in north norway , cormorants are traditionally seen as semi-sacred .
74 [citation needed] it is regarded as good luck to have cormorants gather near your village or settlement .
75  an old legend states that people who die far out at sea , their bodies never recovered , spend eternity on the island utrst  which can only occasionally be found by mortals .
76  the inhabitants of utrst can only visit their homes in the shape of cormorants .
