0 the greater yellowlegs (tringa melanoleuca) is a large north american shorebird , similar in appearance to the smaller lesser yellowlegs .
1  its closest relative , however , is the greenshank , which together with the spotted redshank form a close-knit group .
2  among them , these three species show all the basic leg and foot colors found in the shanks , demonstrating that this character is paraphyletic (pereira & baker , 2005) .
3  they are also the largest shanks apart from the willet , which is altogether more robustly built .
4  the greater yellowlegs and the greenshank share a coarse , dark , and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage .
5 adults have long yellow legs and a long , thin , dark bill which has a slight upward curve and is longer than the head .
6  the body is grey-brown on top and white underneath; the neck and breast are streaked with dark brown .
7  the rump is white .
8  it ranges in length from {convert|29|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on} and in weight from {convert|111|to|250|g|oz|abbr = on} .
9 their breeding habitat is bogs and marshes in the boreal forest region of canada and alaska .
10  they nest on the ground , usually in well-hidden locations near water .
11  the three to four eggs average {convert|50|mm|abbr=on} in length and {convert|33|mm|abbr=on} in breadth and weigh about {convert|28|g|abbr = on} .
12  the incubation period is 23 days .
13  the young leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching and then leave the vicinity of the nest within two days .
14 they migrate to the atlantic and pacific coasts of the united states and south to south america .
15  they are very rare vagrants to western europe .
16 these birds forage in shallow water , sometimes using their bills to stir up the water .
17  they mainly eat insects and small fish , as well as crustaceans and marine worms .
18  it often walks in sand or mud and leaves clear tracks; it can be possible to gather information about this species using its tracks .
19 the call is harsher than that of the lesser yellowlegs .
