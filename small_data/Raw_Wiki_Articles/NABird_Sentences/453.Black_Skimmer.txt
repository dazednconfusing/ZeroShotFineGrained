0 the black skimmer (rynchops niger) is a tern-like seabird , one of three very similar birds species in the skimmer family .
1  it breeds in north and south america .
2  northern populations winter in the warmer waters of the caribbean and the tropical and subtropical pacific coasts , but the south american races make only shorter movements in response to annual floods which extend their feeding areas in the river shallows .
3 == description ==the black skimmer is the largest of the three skimmer species .
4  it measures {convert|40||50|cm|in|abbr=on} long with a {convert|107||127|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
5  this species ranges from {convert|212|to|447|g|oz|abbr=on}, with males averaging about {convert|349|g|oz|abbr=on}, as compared to the smaller females {convert|254|g|oz|abbr=on} .
6  the basal half of the bill is red , the rest mainly black , and the lower mandible is much-elongated .
7  the eye has a dark brown iris and catlike vertical pupil , unique for a bird .
8  the legs are red .
9  the call is a barking kak-kak-kak .
10 adults in breeding plumage have a black crown , nape and upper body .
11  the forehead and underparts are white .
12  the upper wings are black with white on the rear edge , and the tail and rump are dark grey with white edges .
13  the underwing colour varies from white to dusky grey depending on region .
14 non-breeding adults have paler and browner upperparts , and a white nape collar .
15  immature birds have brown upperparts with white feather tips and fringes .
16  the underparts and forehead are white , and the underwings as the adult .
17 == feeding habits ==skimmers have a light graceful flight , with steady beats of their long wings .
18  they feed usually in large flocks , flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water (in order of importance) for small fish , insects , crustaceans and molluscs caught by touch by day or especially at night .
19 they spend much time loafing gregariously on sandbars in the rivers , coasts and lagoons they frequent .
20 ==taxonomy==the black skimmer has three subspecies:== breeding ==the black skimmer breeds in loose groups on sandbanks and sandy beaches in the americas , the three to seven heavily dark-blotched buff or bluish eggs being incubated by both the male and female .
21  the chicks leave the nest as soon as they hatch and lie inconspicuously in the nest depression or "scrape" where they are shaded from high temperatures by the parents .
22  they may dig their own depressions in the sand at times .
23  parents feed the young almost exclusively during the day with almost no feeding occurring at night , due to the entire population of adults sometimes departing the colony to forage .
24  although the mandibles are of equal length at hatching , they rapidly become unequal during fledging .
