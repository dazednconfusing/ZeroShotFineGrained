0 the snowy egret (egretta thula) is a small white heron .
1  it is the american counterpart to the very similar old world little egret , which has established a foothold in the bahamas .
2  at one time , the beautiful plumes of the snowy egret were in great demand by market hunters as decorations for women's hats .
3  this reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels .
4  {citation needed|date=july 2012} now protected in the united states by law , under the migratory bird treaty act , this bird's population has rebounded .
5 ==description==adults are typically {convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on} long and weigh {convert|375|g|lb|abbr=on} they have a slim black bill and long black legs with yellow feet .
6  the area of the upper bill , in front of the eyes , is yellow but turns red during the breeding season , when the adults also gain recurved plumes on the back , making for a "shaggy" effect .
7  the juvenile looks similar to the adult , but the base of the bill is paler , and a green or yellow line runs down the back of the legs .
8 ==behaviour and ecology==snowy egrets nest in colonies on thick vegetation in isolated placessuch as barrier islands , dredge-spoil islands , salt marsh islands , swamps , and marshes .
9  they often change location from year to year .
10  during the breeding season snowy egrets feed in estuaries , saltmarshes , tidal channels , shallow bays , and mangroves .
11  they winter in mangroves , saltwater lagoons , freshwater swamps , grassy ponds , and temporary pools , and forage on beaches , shallow reefs , and wet fields .
12 the snowy egret eats mostly aquatic animals , including fish , frogs , worms , crustaceans , and insects .
13  it often uses its bright yellow feet to paddle in the water or probe in the mud , rounding up prey before striking with its bill .
14  snowy egrets feed while standing , walking , running , or hopping , and they may vibrate their bills , sway their heads , or flick their wings as part of prey gathering .
15  they even forage while hovering .
16  snowy egrets forage in saltmarsh pools , tidal channels , tidal flats , freshwater marshes , swamps , ocean inlets , and lake edges , usually preferring brackish or marine habitats with shallow water .
17  other foraging water birds often assemble around them to form mixed-species foraging groups .
18 snowy egrets are permanent residents in most of south america and central america .
19  in the united states , they are often permanent residents along the atlantic coast north to virginia beach , va , along the gulf coast , and along the pacific lowlands from central california southward .
20  during the breeding season , snowy egrets wander north along the atlantic flyway between the lower chesapeake bay and coastal rhode island , and up the pacific coast to northern california .
21  snowy egrets also breed in the lower mississippi valley westward into eastern texas .
22  birds banded in united states have been recovered as far away as panama and trinidad .
23 ==diet==the birds eat fish , crustaceans , insects , small reptiles , snails , frogs , worms , mice and crayfish .
24  they stalk prey in shallow water , often running or shuffling their feet , flushing prey into view , as well "dip-fishing" by flying with their feet just over the water .
25  snowy egrets may also stand still and wait to ambush prey , or hunt for insects stirred up by domestic animals in open fields .
