0 the semipalmated sandpiper (calidris pusilla) is a very small shorebird .
1  it is sometimes separated with other "stints" in erolia , but , although these apparently form a monophyletic group , the present species' old genus ereunetes had been proposed before erolia .
2 ==description==adults have black legs and a short , stout , straight dark bill .
3  the body is dark grey-brown on top and white underneath .
4  the head and neck are tinged light grey-brown .
5  this bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds , in particular the western sandpiper; these are known collectively as "peeps" or "stints" .
6 ==breeding and habitat==their breeding habitat is the southern tundra in canada and alaska near water .
7  they nest on the ground .
8  the male makes several shallow scrapes; the female chooses one and adds grass and other material to line the nest .
9  the female lays 4 eggs; the male assists in incubation .
10  after a few days , the female leaves the young with the male; the young feed themselves .
11 these birds forage on mudflats , picking up food by sight and feel (bill) .
12  they mainly eat aquatic insects and crustaceans .
13 ==status and migration==they are long distance migrants and winter in coastal south america , with some going to the southern united states .
14  they migrate in flocks which can number in the hundreds of thousands , particularly in favoured feeding locations such as the bay of fundy and delaware bay .
15  this species is a rare but regular vagrant to western europe .
16 although very numerous , these birds are highly dependent on a few key stopover habitats during their migration , notably mary's point and johnson's mills along shepody bay , an arm of the bay of fundy .
17  during the months of july and august , the nature conservancy of canada runs an information center about these shorebirds in johnson's mills , new brunswick .
