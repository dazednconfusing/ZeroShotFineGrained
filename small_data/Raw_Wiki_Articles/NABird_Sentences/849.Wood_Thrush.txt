0 the wood thrush (hylocichla mustelina) is a north american passerine bird .
1  it is closely related to other thrushes such as the american robin and is widely distributed across north america , wintering in central america and southern mexico .
2  the wood thrush is the official bird of the district of columbia .
3 the wood thrush is a medium-sized thrush , with brown upper parts with mottled brown and white underparts .
4  the male and female are similar in appearance .
5  the song of the male is often cited as being the most beautiful in north america .
6 the wood thrush is an omnivore , and feeds preferentially on soil invertebrates and larvae , but will also eat fruits .
7  in the summer , it feeds on insects continuously in order to meet daily metabolic needs .
8  it is solitary , but sometimes forms mixed-species flocks .
9  the wood thrush defends a territory that ranges in size from {convert|800|to|28000|m2|sqyd|abbr=on} .
10  the wood thrush is monogamous , and its breeding season begins in the spring; about 50% of all mated pairs are able to raise two broods , ranging in size from two to four chicks .
11 ==taxonomy==the only member of the genus hylocichla , the wood thrush was described by german naturalist johann friedrich gmelin in 1789. the generic name is a direct translation of its common name , derived from the greek words hyle/ "woodland" and cichle/ "thrush" or "fieldfare" .
12  the specific name comes from the latin mustela "weasel" .
13  it is closely related to the other typical american thrushes of the genus catharus , and is sometimes merged into that genus .
14  it has been considered close to the long-distance migrant species of that genus , as opposed to the generally resident nightingale-thrushes , but this appears to be erroneous .
15  the wood thrush also appears to be fairly closely related to the large turdus thrushes , such as the american robin .
16 ==description==the adult wood thrush is {convert|18|to|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on} long , with a wingspan of {convert|30|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on} and a body mass of {convert|48|to|72|g|oz|abbr=on} .
17  among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|9.6|to|11.6|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1.6|to|2|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|2.8|to|3.3|cm|in|abbr=on} .
18  it is distinctly larger than the catharus thrushes with which the species is often sympatric but slightly smaller than the common american robin .
19  the longest known lifespan for a wood thrush in the wild is 8 years , 11 months .
20  the crown , nape , and upper back are cinnamon-brown , while the back wings , and tail are a slightly duller brown .
21  the breast and belly are white with large dark brown spots on the breast , sides , and flanks .
22  it has white eye rings and pink legs .
23  other brownish thrushes have finer spotting on the breast .
24  the juvenile looks similar to adults , but has additional spots on the back , neck , and wing coverts .
25  the male and female are similar in size and plumage .
26 ===vocalizations===the wood thrush has been reported to have one of the most beautiful songs of north american birds .
27  american naturalist henry david thoreau wrote:whenever a man hears it he is young , and nature is in her spring; wherever he hears it , it is a new world and a free country , and the gates of heaven are not shut against him .
28 while the female is not known to sing , the male has a unique song that has three parts .
29  the first subsong component is often inaudible unless the listener is close , and consists of two to six short , low-pitched notes such as bup , bup , bup .
30  the middle part is a loud phrase often written ee-oh-lay , and the third part is a ventriloquial , trill-like phrase of non-harmonic pairs of notes given rapidly and simultaneously .
31 the male is able to sing two notes at once , which gives its song an ethereal , flute-like quality .
32  each individual bird has its own repertoire based on combinations of variations of the three parts .
33  songs are often repeated in order .
34  the bup , bup , bup phrase is also sometimes used as a call , which is louder and at a greater frequency when the bird is agitated .
35  the wood thrush also use a tut , tut to signal agitation .
36  the nocturnal flight call is an emphatic buzzing heeh .
37 ==distribution and habitat==the wood thrush's breeding range extends from manitoba , ontario and nova scotia in southern canada to northern florida and from the atlantic coast to the missouri river and the eastern great plains .
38  it migrates to southern mexico through to panama in central america in the winter , mostly in the lowlands along the atlantic and pacific coasts .
39  it generally arrives on the u.s.
41  gulf coast during the first week of april .
42  fall migration usually begins in mid-august and continues through mid-september .
43  migration takes place at night , allowing them to find their direction from the stars and orient themselves by detecting the earth's magnetic field .
44 the wood thrush prefers deciduous and mixed forests for breeding .
45  it prefers late-successional , upland mesic forests with a moderately-dense shrub layer .
46  robert i .
47  bertin (1977) found that this thrush favors areas with running water , moist ground , and high understorey cover .
48  the breeding habitat generally includes trees taller than {convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}, a fairly open forest floor , moist soil , and leaf litter , with substrate moisture more important than either canopy cover or access to running water .
49  the wood thrush can breed in habitat patches as small as {convert|0.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}, but it runs the risk of higher predation and nest parasitism .
50  the wood thrush's breeding range has expanded northward , displacing the veery and hermit thrush in some locations .
51  in recent times , as a result of fragmentation of forests , it has been increasingly exposed to nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds , as well as loss of habitat in the winter range .
52 ===conservation status===the wood thrush has become a symbol of the decline of neotropical songbirds of eastern north america , having declined by approximately 50% since 1966. along with many other species , this thrush faces threats both to its north american breeding grounds and central american wintering grounds .
53  forest fragmentation in north american forests has resulted in both increased nest predation and increased cowbird parasitism , significantly reducing their reproductive success .
54  a study by the cornell laboratory of ornithology was the first large-scale analysis that linked acid rain to this thrush's decline .
55  continued destruction of primary forest in central america eliminated preferred wood thrush wintering habitats , likely forcing the birds to choose secondary habitats where mortality rates are higher .
56  in spite of this , the wood thrush is still considered to be of least concern .
57 ===vagrancy===the wood thrush has been recorded twice as a vagrant in europe , in iceland at kvsker in rfi east skaftafellsssla by bjrnsson hlfdn on 23 october 1967 and on wingletang down , st agnes , isles of scilly , england on 7 october 1987.==behavior==the wood thrush is primarily solitary , but occasionally forms mixed-species flocks in the winter .
58  its breeding territory ranges from {convert|800|to|8000|m2|sqyd|abbr=on} in size , and are used for nesting , gathering nest materials , and foraging .
59  some wood thrushes also defend a feeding territory in the winter .
60  territorial interactions are usually settled without physical contact , but in high-intensity encounters or nest defense , physical interactions with the feet or bill have been observed .
61  defense behaviors in response to nest predators include wing flicks , tail flicks , and raising the crest , sometimes escalating to dives and strikes .
62 this species has also been observed displaying a behavior known as "anting .
63 " anting occurs when a bird picks up a single ant or group of ants and rubs them on its feathers .
64  the purpose of this behavior is unknown , but it is thought that the birds may be able to acquire defensive secretions from the ants possibly used for some medicinal purposes , or that it simply supplements the birds' own preen oil .
65 ===diet===soil invertebrates and larvae make up most of the wood thrush's omnivorous diet , but it will also eat fruits in the late summer , fall , and late winter .
66  it occasionally feeds on arboreal insects , snails , and small salamanders .
67  the young are fed insects and some fruit .
68  after breeding and before migration , the wood thrush will switch from insects to fruits with high lipid levels .
69  in the summer , low fruit consumption and lipid reserves require the bird to feed on insects continuously in order to meet its metabolic needs .
70 the wood thrush forages mainly on the forest floor , flipping leaves over with their bills to reveal insects .
71  it can be observed hopping around in leaf litter and on semi-bare ground under the forest canopy .
72  fruits are swallowed whole .
73 ===predation===eggs and chicks are vulnerable to chipmunks , raccoons , blue jays , american crows , black rat snakes , brown-headed cowbirds , common grackles , southern flying squirrels , gray squirrels , least weasels , white-footed mice , domestic cats , great horned owls , and sharp-shinned hawks .
74  adults are primarily taken by hawks and owls .
75 ===reproduction===wood thrushes are monogamous .
76  breeding pairs form in mid-april to early-may , and usually last throughout the breeding season .
77  most thrushes find a new mate each year , and mate guarding and extra-pair copulations have not been observed in this species .
78 some male wood thrushes arrive at the breeding grounds several days before the earliest females while other males arrive at the same time as the females , establishing territories ranging in size from 0.08 to 0.8 hectares (one-fifth of an acre to two acres) .
79  the female typically leads silent circular flights {convert|1|-|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on} from the ground , with the male chasing .
80  six or more flights generally take place in succession .
81  the pairs will perch together and feed each other in between flights .
82  the male begins to sing at dawn and dusk a few days after arriving at breeding grounds .
83  early in the breeding season , the male sings from high perches in the tallest trees , but as the season progresses , it sings somewhat shorter and less elaborate songs from lower perches .
84  each day's singing begins and is most intense just before sunrise .
85  the male may sing throughout the day but especially at dusk .
86  the song season is usually over by the end of july .
87 typically , the female chooses the nest site and builds the nest .
88  however , there has been some indication that the male is able to influence the selection of the nest site by perching nearby and singing .
89  usually , though , the female chooses whether or not to accept or reject the nest site suggested by the male .
90  the nest is usually sited in a dense patch of vegetation in a tree or shrub that provides concealment and shade .
91  it is usually made of dead grasses , stems , and leaves , and lined with mud , and placed in a fork at a horizontal branch .
92  the nest is not reused .
93  usually , two broods are attempted , although three to four separate nests may be built before a pair succeeds .
94  two to four pale blue eggs are laid at the rate of one per day .
95  the eggs are incubated by the female only for 11 to 14 days , with the average being 13 days .
96  like all passerines , the chicks are altricial at hatching , mostly naked with closed eyes .
97  the female broods the chicks during the first four days after hatching .
98  both parents feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs from the nest .
99  the chicks fledge 1215 days after hatching , but the parents continue to feed them until they become independent and leave the parents' territory at 2131 days old .
100 the young wood thrush is able to begin breeding the next summer .
101  most females lay their first eggs in mid-may , but older females may begin laying sooner .
102  pairs usually attempt to rear a second brood no later than late july , with the last of the young fledging around mid-august .
103  about half of all wood thrush pairs successfully raise two broods .
