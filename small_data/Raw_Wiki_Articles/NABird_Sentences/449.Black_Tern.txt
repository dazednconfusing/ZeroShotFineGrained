0 the black tern (chlidonias niger or chlidonias nigra) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in europe and north america .
1  as its name suggests , it has predominantly dark plumage .
2  in some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season , hence the old english name "blue darr" .
3  the scientific name means "like a swallow" .
4 == description ==adults are {convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on} long , with a wingspan {convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}, and weigh {convert|62|g|oz|abbr=on} .
5  they have short dark legs and a short , weak-looking black bill , measuring {convert|27|mm|in|abbr=on}, nearly as long as the head .
6  the bill is long , slender , and looks slightly decurved .
7  they have a dark grey back , with a white forewing , black head , neck (occasionally suffused with grey in the adult) and belly , black or blackish-brown cap (which unites in color with the ear coverts , forming an almost complete hood), and a light brownish-grey , 'square' tail .
8  the face is white .
9  there is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye , and a broadish white collar in juveniles .
10  there are greyish-brown smudges on the ides of the white breast , a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts .
11  these marks vary in size and are not conspicuous .
12  in non-breeding plumage , most of the black , apart from the cap , is replaced by grey .
13  the plumage of the upperparts is drab , with pale feather-edgings .
14  the rump is brownish-grey .
15 the north american race , c .
16  n .
17  surinamensis , is distinguishable from the european form in all plumages , and is considered by some to be a separate species .
18 in flight , the build appears slim .
19  the wing-beats are full and dynamic , and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food; similar to other tern species .
20 its call has been described as a high-pitched "kik";  the sound of a large flock has been called  "deafening" .
21 == hybridisation with white-winged black tern ==hybridisation between this species and white-winged black tern has been recorded from sweden and the netherlands .
22  two juvenile birds at chew valley lake , england , in september 1978 and september 1981, were also believed to be hybrids; they showed mixed characters of the two species , specifically a combination of a dark mantle (a feature of white-winged black) with dark patches on the breast-side (a feature of black tern , not shown by white-winted black) .
23 == distribution and habitat ==their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across most of canada , the northern united states and much of europe and western asia .
24  they usually nest either on floating material in a marsh or on the ground very close to water , laying 24 eggs .
25 in england  the black tern was abundant in the  eastern fens , especially in  lincolnshire and cambridgeshire ,  until the early nineteenth century .
26   the  english naturalist  thomas pennant   in 1769 referred to   "vast flocks"  of black terns  "whose calls are almost deafening" .
27   extensive drainage of its breeding grounds wiped out the english  population by about 1840. intermittent attempts by the species  to recolonise england  have proved unsuccessful , with only a handful of english  breeding records , and one in ireland ,  in the second half of the twentieth century .
