0 bonaparte's gull (chroicocephalus philadelphia) is a small gull found mainly in north america .
1 taxonomy and etymologywhen george ord first described bonaparte's gull in 1815, he gave it the scientific name sterna philadelphia , assigning it to the genus now used for medium-sized terns .
2  most later taxonomists assigned it to the genus larus , a longtime catch-all for most of the gull species .
3  however , in 1858, george newbold lawrence moved the species to the genus chroicocephalus , and some taxonomists followed suit .
4 [2] recent molecular dna studies have shown that this species fits neatly into a clade with other "masked gulls", and that it and the slender-billed gull are each others' closest relatives[3] and are basal to the rest of that grouping .
5 [3] based on these studies , the american ornithologists' union , which had previously assigned the species to the genus larus , moved it into its current genus in 2008.[4] it is monotypic across its range .
6 [5]the species is named for charles lucien bonaparte , a french ornithologist (and nephew to the former french emperor napoleon bonaparte) who spent eight years in america , contributing to the understanding of the taxonomy and nomenclature of birds there and elsewhere .
7  its genus name , chroicocephalus , is a combination of the greek words chroikos , an adjective form of chroa meaning "colour", and kephal meaning "head" .
8  this refers to the dark heads that gulls of this genus show during the breeding season .
9  the specific epithet philadelphia is a latinized adjective meaning "from philadelphia", a reference to the location from which the type specimen was collected .
10 [6]descriptionbonaparte's gull is among the smallest of the gull species; only the little gull and saunders's gull are smaller .
11 [7] adults range from 28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in) in length , with a wingspan of 7684 cm (3033 in) and a body mass of 180225 g (6.37.9 oz) .
12 [8] there is no difference in plumage or bare part colour between the sexes ,[9] though males tend to be heavier than females .
13 [10] the adult has grey upperparts and white underparts , with black wingtips which are pale on the underside .
14  in breeding plumage , the adult has a black hood and a short thin dark bill .
15  the underwing is pale and the wing tips are dark .
16  they have pink legs .
17  in winter , the head is white .
18 in their first summer , the appearance of bonaparte's gull is similar to that in its first winter , but paler due to wear .
19  fewer than 5% of bonaparte's gulls acquire a dark hood in their first summer , and on those that do , the hood is duller than on breeding adults .
20 habitat and rangebonaparte's gull breeds in boreal forest across southern alaska and much of interior western canada , as far east as central quebec and south to within 320 km (200 mi) of the united states/canada border .
21 [11] it avoids dense stands of conifers , instead choosing more open areas , such as the treed edges of bogs , fens , marshes , ponds , or islands .
22  it typically nests within 60 m (200 ft) of open water .
23 [12] it winters along the coasts of north america , and in the great lakes .
24 [11] it is a rare vagrant to western europe and the azores , where it generally associates with black-headed gulls .
25 [13]behaviourthey are migratory and most move east or west to coastal waters , also the great lakes .
26  these birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming or wading .
27  they are graceful in flight , more like terns .
28 feedinglike most gulls , bonaparte's gull has a varied diet , with prey items changing over the course of the year , and from year to year .
29  during the breeding season , it is largely insectivorous .
30 [14] it is known to quickly congregate in large numbers to take advantage of termite dispersal flights , circling over the emerging swarm and hovering briefly to take the insects in flight .
31 [15] during migration and into the winter , insects are first supplemented , then replaced by other food items , including fish , small crustaceans , mollusks , euphausiids , marine worms , and other invertebrates .
32 [14]bonaparte's gulls are known to engage in kleptoparasitism , and have been observed stealing earthworms from foraging dunlins and black-bellied plovers .
33 [16]breedingonce they leave the nest , chicks follow their parents to the nearest water .
34 bonaparte's gulls begin breeding at two years of age; they are thought to be monogamous .
35 [12] the breeding season begins in mid-june .
36 [17] courting pairs perform swooping display flights , calling loudly and diving at each other , and then drop down to perch on a branch .
37  crouched and facing each other , with neck and crown feathers erected and wings slightly raised , they scream at each other with bills opened wide , bobbing up and down as they do so .
38  this display can continue for several minutes before ending abruptly; afterwards , the birds may sit quietly together for some time before separating again .
39 [18]they raise a single brood per year ,[17] nesting singly or in loose colonies of 220 pairs , with nests spaced at least 3050 m (98164 ft) apart .
40  unlike most other gulls , bonaparte's gulls typically nest in trees  almost exclusively conifers , including black spruce , atlantic white cedar , tamarack and jack pine .
41 [12] both sexes help to build the nest ,[19] which is a platform of small sticks , sometimes with lichen , moss or marsh vegetation added , measuring about 25 cm (9.8 in) in diameter .
42 [12] most nests are placed 36 m (9.819.7 ft) above the ground , and within 60 m (200 ft) of open water , though they have been found low as 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in), as high as 15 m (49 ft), and as far as 180 m (590 ft) from open water .
43  they are only rarely placed on the ground .
44  adults are aggressive in defending their nests , chasing away even large potential predators such as hawks , common ravens and humans .
45  there is some evidence that human activity in the area of their nests may cause decreased productivity  they are known to travel as far as a kilometer (about a half mile) to mob people , for example  but , contrarily , some choose to nest near human habitation .
46 [12]the female lays a clutch of 24 eggs , with most nests containing 3 eggs .
47  the eggs are subelliptical , slightly glossy and smooth , measuring 49 mm  34 mm (1.9 in  1.3 in)[12] and weighing 28.5 g (1.01 oz) .
48 [20] they range in colour from pale to medium green , olive or buff , and may be variably marked with spots , blotches , or scrawls of brown , grey , violet , or black; these markings may be fine and evenly distributed over the entire surface of the egg , or thick and concentrated towards the egg's larger end .
49 [17] the eggs are incubated by both parents for 2224 days .
50 [12][17] studies have shown that breeding populations can be significantly impacted by bad weather .
51  in one multi-year study in churchill , manitoba , for example , more than half of the eggs laid in observed nests were blown out of those nests during storms; only 42% of eggs survived to hatching .
52 [21]hatchling bonaparte's gulls are semi-precocial , emerging from their eggs covered with natal down feathers , and with eyes already opened .
53  the down is yellowish-buff , greyer on the flanks and belly , and somewhat pinkish on the breast , with dark brown mottling on the upperparts and head .
54  the bill is blue-black with a pinkish base , and the legs and feet are pinkish-buff .
55 [17] young birds typically leave the nest within 27 days of hatching , jumping out and following their parents to the nearest open water .
56 [19] both parents tend the young .
57 [17] the time it takes the young to fledge is unknown .
58 [12] bonaparte's gulls may live to 18 years .
59 [22]voicebonaparte's gull has a voice described as nasal and raspy , with calls variously transcribed as cherr or cheeer .
60 [23]conservationbecause of its extremely large range and its increasing population , bonaparte's gull is listed as a species of least concern by the international union for the conservation of nature .
61 [1] in north america , it is protected by the migratory bird treaty act .
62 [24] like many birds , it hosts a number of internal and external parasites .
63  the linguatulid species reighardia sternae ,[25] a tiny , worm-like crustacean , is sometimes found in the gull's air sacs .
64 [26] the acanthocephala worm corynosoma bipapillum is sometimes found in the bird's posterior gut ,[27] as is the intestinal worm echinostomum spinulosum .
65 [28] gigantobilharzia lawayi , a schistosome (or blood fluke) may be carried in the capillaries .
66 [29] externally , it is known to carry several species of lice , including actornithophilus funebre , degeeriella atrimarginata , degeeriella punctata , menopon species , and philopterus gonothorax .
