0 the pileated woodpecker (dryocopus pileatus) is a very large north american woodpecker , roughly crow-sized , inhabiting deciduous forests in eastern north america , the great lakes , the boreal forests of canada , and parts of the pacific coast .
1  it is also the largest woodpecker in the united states , except the possibly extinct ivory-billed woodpecker .
2 ==description==adults are {convert|40|to|49|cm|in|abbr=on} long , span {convert|66|to|75|cm|in|abbr=on} across the wings and weigh {convert|250|to|400|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average weight of {convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on} .
3  each wing measures {convert|21.4|to|25.3|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail measures {convert|14|to|17.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|4.1|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus measures {convert|3.1|-|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on} .
4  they are mainly black with a red crest , and have a white line down the sides of the throat .
5  they show white on the wings in flight .
6  the flight of these birds is strong and direct but has an undulating quality , similar to the relatively unique flight-style of all woodpeckers .
7  adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat , in adult females these are black .
8  two species found in the old world , the white-bellied and black woodpeckers are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in north america .
9  the only north american birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the southeastern united states and cuba , and the related imperial woodpecker of mexico .
10  however , unlike the pileated , both of those species are extremely rare , if not extinct .
11  most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated .
12 the call is a loud , far-carrying laugh , sometimes described as a "jungle bird" call due to its wild , un-fettered quality .
13  the northern flicker , which is very different looking and weighs about half as much as a pileated , has a similar-sounding call but has a weaker voice .
14  its drumming can be very loud , often sounding like someone striking a tree with a hammer .
15 ===subspecies===up to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically .
16  however , many authors only recognize two subspecies , the southernly d .
17  p .
18  pileatus and the northerly d .
19  p .
20  abieticola , and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described .
21  generally , pileated woodpeckers follow bergmann's rule being smaller and more compact in the south (pileatus) and larger in the north (abieticola) .
22  the ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below .
23 ==distribution and habitat==their breeding habitat is forested areas across canada , the eastern united states and parts of the pacific coast .
24  this bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks .
25  they specifically prefer mesic habitats with large , mature hardwood trees , often being found in large tracts of forest .
26  however , they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees .
27 ==behavior==these birds mainly eat insects , especially carpenter ants and wood-boring beetle larvae .
28  they also eat fruits , nuts , and berries , including poison ivy berries .
29  pileated woodpeckers will often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects , especially ant galleries .
30  they also will lap up ants by reaching with their long tongue into crevices .
31  they are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines .
32  pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground , especially around fallen , dead trees , which can contain a smorgasbord of insect life .
33  they may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders .
34  although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers , pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions .
35 usually , pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees .
36  woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half .
37  the roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes .
38  pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree .
39  in april , the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young .
40  once the brood is raised , the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and will not use it the next year .
41  when abandoned , these holesmade similarly by all woodpeckersprovide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals .
42  owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests .
43  even mammals such as raccoons may use them .
44  other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them .
45  ecologically , the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species .
46  the pileated woodpecker will also nest in nest boxes about {convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on} off the ground .
47 a pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is a non-migratory species .
48  it will defend the territory in all seasons , but will tolerate floaters during the winter .
49  when clashing with conspecifics , they engage in much chasing , calling , striking with the wings , and jabbing with the bill .
50  drumming is most commonly to proclaim a territory and hollow trees are often used to make the largest sound possible .
51 pileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nesta rare habit in birds .
52  the cavity is unlined except for wood chips .
53  both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days .
54  there is an average of clutch size of 4 per nest .
55  the young may take a month to fledge .
56  the oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old .
57  predators at the nest can include american martens , weasels , squirrels , rat snakes and gray foxes .
58  free-flying adults have fewer predators but can be taken in some numbers by cooper's hawks , northern goshawks , red-tailed hawks , great horned owls and barred owls .
59 ==status==the pileated woodpecker occupies a large range and is quite adaptable .
60  its ability to survive in many wooded habitat types has allowed the species to survive human habitation of north america much better than the more specialized ivory-billed woodpecker .
61  pileated woodpeckers have a large population size and , despite being non-migratory , are protected under the u.s.
63  migratory bird act .
64  due to the considerable damage that pileated woodpeckers can do to trees , some people may consider them harmful if found on their property , but the large birds control many insect populations , especially tree beetles , that may otherwise experience outbreaks .
