0 the florida scrub jay (aphelocoma coerulescens{ref label|etymology|a|a}) is one of the species of scrub jay native to north america .
1  it is the only species of bird endemic to the u.s.
3  state of florida and one of only 15 species endemic to the continental united states .
4  because of this , it is heavily sought by birders who travel from across the country to observe this unique species .
5  it is known to have been present in florida as a distinct species for at least 2 million years , and is possibly derived from the ancestors of woodhouse's scrub jay , the inland forms of the western scrub jay .
6 it measures {convert|23|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , and weighs from {convert|66|to|92|g|oz|abbr=on}, with an average {convert|80.2|g|oz|abbr=on} .
7  the wingspan of the jay is {convert|33|-|36|cm|in|abbr=on} .
8  it has a strong black bill , blue head and nape without a crest , a whitish forehead and supercilium , blue bib , blue wings , grayish underparts , gray back , long blue tail , black legs and feet .
9 ==ecology==the florida scrub jay is found only in florida scrub habitat , an ecosystem that exists only in central florida and is characterized by nutrient-poor soil , occasional drought , and frequent wildfires .
10  because of its somewhat harsh weather pattern , this habitat is host to a small assortment of very specific plants , including sand pine , sand live oak , myrtle oak , chapman's oak , sandhill oak , florida rosemary and various other hardy plants such as eastern prickly pear .
11 florida scrub jays are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of acorns , seeds , peanuts , insects , tree frogs , turtles , snakes , lizards , and young mice .
12  florida scrub jays have also been occasionally observed to eat other birds' eggs or nestlings , but this occurs rarely .
13  they routinely cache thousands of acorns a year , burying them just beneath the surface .
14  the acorns are typically buried in the fall and consumed during the winter and spring .
15  acorns that are forgotten or missed may germinate , making the florida scrub jay an effective agent for the dispersal of a variety of oak trees .
16 scrub jays may also take silverware and other shiny objects in a manner similar to the american crow .
17 ===reproduction===florida scrub jays are one of the few cooperative breeding birds in north america .
18  fledgling florida scrub jays remain in their parents' habitat for several years and help to rear young , watch for predators (such as short-tailed or accipiter hawks), and defend territory against neighboring florida scrub jay family groups .
19  these families can range in size from 2 to 8.==conservation==scrub habitat has dwindled considerably in the past several decades as florida has continued to develop .
20  wildfire suppression also leads to the natural succession of large oaks and trees which changes the habitat .
21  in recent years , environmental groups within the state have made a strong effort at preserving florida's remaining scrub through controlled burns and even clearing out areas of large trees to increase the size of a scrub habitat .
22   oscar scherer state park near sarasota has one of the larger habitats under state management .
23 the florida scrub jay was officially listed as a threatened state species by florida fish and wildlife conservation commission in 1975 and it was listed as a threatened federal species by the united states fish and wildlife service in 1987.in 1993, there were estimated to be 4000 breeding pairs left in the wild .
24  despite the protections , the scrub jay is still thought to be on the decline .
25  studies done in brevard county , once the most numerous florida county for scrub jays , noted declines of about 33% since the 1993 census alone .
26 another attempt to conserve the bird is an ongoing campaign to name the florida scrub jay the new state bird of florida .
27  the main argument for changing the state bird is that the current state bird (viz .
28  the northern mockingbird) is the state bird of several other states , while the scrub jay is exclusive to florida .
29 in recent years there has been some debate about whether or not the florida scrub jay should be officially listed as an endangered species because of the loss of homes .
30  however , environmentalists hope that current conservation efforts should help the species population to at least stabilize .
31 on the other hand , the iucn classifies this species as vulnerable to extinction .
32  in 2004, the population was declining and no more than 10 subpopulations were known .
33  both the number of adult birds as well as amount and quality of habitat were in decline , and local subpopulations were in danger of disappearing altogether .
34  about 8000 mature birds were believed to existwith no more than 1000 in any one subpopulationand population numbers had dropped by about 10% over the last decade or so .
35 a long-term and ongoing study of the florida scrub jay has been taking place at the archbold biological station at lake placid .
36 the florida scrub jay was featured in episode 11, season 3 of the showtime television series penn & teller: bullshit! .
37 ===dangers of human feeding===an inquisitive and intelligent species , the most striking attribute of the florida scrub jay's behavior is its remarkable tameness .
38   as such , scrub jays willingly take food from human hands .
39 unfortunately , this tameness is dangerous to the well-being of the species .
40  florida scrub jays that are fed by humans will reproduce earlier in the year than those that are not .
41   however , fledgling scrub jays feed primarily on caterpillars present in the late spring and summer; if they hatch too early in the year when the caterpillars are not available , this can lead to their malnutrition or starvation .
42 another potential danger of feeding florida scrub jays occurs when people feed them near a road , as one major cause of death for scrub jays in urban areas is collision with vehicles .
