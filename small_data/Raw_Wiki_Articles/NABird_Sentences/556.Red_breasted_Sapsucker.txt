0 the red-breasted sapsucker (sphyrapicus ruber), is a medium-sized woodpecker of the forests of the west coast of north america .
1 ==description==adults have a red head and upper chest; they have a white lower belly and rump .
2  they are black on the back and wings with bars; they have a large white wing patch .
3  red-breasted sapsuckers nest in tree cavities .
4  northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range; birds on the coast are often permanent residents .
5  like other sapsuckers , these birds drill holes in trees and eat the sap as well as insects attracted to it .
6  they sometimes catch insects in flight; they also eat seeds and berries .
7  these birds interbreed with the red-naped sapsucker or yellow-bellied sapsucker where their ranges overlap .
8 ==taxonomy and systematics==until recently , the red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker were considered a single species .
9  sapsuckers are in the picidae , or woodpecker , family , in the order piciformes .
10 ===subspecies===the wing barring is white in both variants .
11 ==distribution and habitat ==red-breasted sapsuckers breed from southeast alaska and british columbia south through the pacific coast ranges of western washington and oregon and northern california .
12  the breeding habitat is usually forest that includes pine , hemlock , douglas-fir , fir , and spruce , though they are known to use other woodland habitats .
13 ===migration===the northern birds that breed in migrate south in the winter , and individuals that breed in inland and upland locales often move to the coastal lowlands in winter , where the weather is milder .
14  winter habitat can be deciduous or coniferous woodland .
15  this species winter range extends south to baja california in mexico .
16 ==ecology==red-breasted sapsuckers prefer old-growth forest .
17   they require living trees to provide the sap on which they feed .
18 ===feeding===a sapsuckers tongue is adapted with stiff hairs for collecting the sap .
19  red-breasted sapsuckers visit the same tree multiple times , drilling holes in neat horizontal rows .
20   a bird will leave and come back later , when the sap has started flowing from the holes .
21   repeated visits over an extended period of time can actually kill the tree .
22  the insects attracted to the sap are also consumed , and not only by sapsuckers .
23   rufous hummingbirds , for example , have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source .
24 ===breeding===the red-breasted sapsucker begins work on its nest hole in a dead tree , usually a deciduous tree , in april or may , and produces one brood per breeding season .
25  the female lays 4-7 pure white eggs .
26  both parents feed the young , and the fledglings leave the nest at 2328 days old .
27  the nest cavity is not reused .
28 ==behavior==these birds make various noises; their vocalizations include a variety of chatter , squeals , and scream-like calls , and they also drum with their bills on various surfaces .
29   many of these noises serve to establish territory and attract a mate .
30  this is in addition to the noise made by drilling holes for feeding and by excavating nest cavities .
