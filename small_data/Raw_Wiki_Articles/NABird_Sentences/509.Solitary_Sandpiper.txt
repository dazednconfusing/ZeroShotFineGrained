0 the solitary sandpiper (tringa solitaria) is a small wader (shorebird) .
1 ==description==this species measures {convert|18|-|23|cm|in|abbr=on} long , with a wingspan up to {convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on} and a body mass of {convert|31|-|65|g|oz|abbr=on} .
2  it is a dumpy wader with a dark green back , greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts .
3  it is obvious in flight , with wings dark above and below , and a dark rump and tail centre .
4  the latter feature distinguishes it from the slightly larger and broader-winged , but otherwise very similar , green sandpiper of europe and asia , to which it is closely related .
5  the latter species has a brilliant white rump .
6  in flight , the solitary sandpiper has a characteristic three-note whistle .
7  they both have brown wings with little light dots , and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern .
8  in addition , both species nest in trees , unlike most other scolopacids .
9 ==distribution and habitat==it breeds in woodlands across alaska and canada .
10  it is a migratory bird , wintering in central and south america , especially in the amazon river basin , and the caribbean .
11  it is a very rare vagrant to western europe .
12 ===subspecies===the solitary sandpiper is split into two subspecies:==behaviour==the solitary sandpiper is not a gregarious species , usually seen alone during migration , although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas .
13  the solitary sandpiper is very much a bird of fresh water , and is often found in sites , such as ditches , too restricted for other waders , which tend to like a clear all-round view .
14 ===breeding===the sandpiper lays a clutch of 35 eggs in abandoned tree nests of songbird species , such as those of thrushes .
15  the young birds are encouraged to drop to the ground soon after hatching .
16 ===feeding===food is small invertebrates , sometimes small frogs , picked off the mud as the bird works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond .
