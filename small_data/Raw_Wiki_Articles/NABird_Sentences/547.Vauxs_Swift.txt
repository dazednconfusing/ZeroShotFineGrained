30 swifts at chapman elementary schoolthe "chapman swifts" are part of a migratory population of vaux's swifts that roost seasonally in the chimney of chapman elementary school in portland , oregon .
31  this is north america's largest concentration of vaux's swifts .
32 [4]every evening from mid-august to mid-october , thousands of swifts gather in the sky over the school shortly before sunset .
33  count estimates of 1,700 to 35,000 swifts have been reported .
34  shortly after sunset , over a period of 10 to 30 minutes , they fly into the top of the brick chimney (constructed c.1925) to roost on the interior surface until they depart at sunrise .
35 [5] the school is on the birds' migratory route to their wintering sites in southern central america and venezuela .
36 [6]the swifts attract several predators , such as peregrine falcons and cooper's hawks , as well as hundreds to thousands[5][7] of human spectators .
37 [8]historythe birds began using the site in the early 1980s in response to the loss of much of their natural roosting habitat  old growth douglas-fir and forest snags .
38 [9] vaux's swifts prefer roosting in standing hollow trees .
39 [6]to protect the swifts , the school stopped using its heating system during the weeks of roosting .
40  students and teachers wore sweaters and jackets , especially toward the end of september when classroom temperatures can drop to 50 to 60 f (10 to 16 c) .
41 [10] around 2003, the audubon society of portland , school fundraisers and corporate sponsors donated $60,000[9] to $75,000[11] for an alternate school heating system which is independent of the brick chimney .
42  the chimney is now maintained solely for the use of the birds .
