0 wilson's snipe (gallinago delicata) is a small , stocky shorebird .
1  this species was considered to be a subspecies of the common snipe (g .
2  gallinago) until 2003 when it was given its own species status , though not all authorities recognized this immediately .
3  wilson's snipe differs from the latter species in having a narrower white trailing edge to the wings , and eight pairs of tail feathers instead of the typical seven of the common snipe .
4  its common name commemorates the american ornithologist alexander wilson .
5 ==description==adults are {convert|23||28|cm|in|abbr=on} in length with a {convert|39||45|cm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
6  they have short greenish-grey legs and a very long straight dark bill .
7  the body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath .
8  they have a dark stripe through the eye , with light stripes above and below it .
9  the wings are pointed .
10 ==breeding and habits==they breed in marshes , bogs , tundra and wet meadows in canada and the northern united states .
11  they are year-round residents on the u.s.
13  pacific coast .
14  the eastern population migrates to the southern united states and to northern south america .
15  it may be that climate change causes these birds to move to their breeding range earlier and leave later than 100 years ago .
16  in ohio for example , late april was recorded as an average migration date in 1906, but now most of the local population is present on the breeding grounds by then already .
17 they forage in soft mud , probing or picking up food by sight and eating insects , earthworms , and plant material .
18  well-camouflaged , they are usually shy and conceal themselves close to ground vegetation , flushing only when approached closely .
19  they fly off in a series of aerial zig-zags to confuse predators .
20 the male performs "winnowing" display during courtship , flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a distinctive sound .
21  they have been observed "winnowing" throughout the day and long into the night .
22  the "winnowing" sound is similar to the call of a boreal owl .
23  they nest in a well-hidden location on the ground .
24 ==population==the wilson's snipe was reduced near the end of the 19th century by hunting and habitat destruction .
25  however , this bird remains fairly common and not considered threatened by the iucn .
26  it is apparently less tolerant of habitat destruction than the american woodcock , declining markedly when faced with large-scale draining of marshland .
