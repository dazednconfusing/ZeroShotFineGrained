0 the royal tern (thalasseus maximus) is a seabird in the tern family sternidae .
1  this bird has two distinctive subspecies: t .
2  m .
3  maximus which lives on the atlantic and pacific coasts of the north and south america , and the slightly smaller t .
4  m .
5  albididorsalis lives on the coast of west africa .
6  the royal tern has a red-orange bill and a black cap during the breeding season , but in the winter the cap becomes patchy .
7  the royal tern is found in europe , africa , the americas , and the caribbean islands .
8  the royal tern lives on the coast and is only found near salt water .
9  they tend to feed near the shore , close to the beach or in backwater bays .
10  the royal tern's conservation status is listed as least concern .
11 ==taxonomy==the royal tern belongs to the class aves and the order charadriiformes .
12  charadriiformes are mainly seabirds of small to medium-large size .
13  the royal tern is also in the family sternidae because of its white plumage , black cap on its head , long bill , webbed feet , and bodies that are more streamlined than those of gulls .
14 the taxonomy of the royal tern has been debated , whether the correct scientific name was thalasseus maximus or sterna maxima .
15  it is presently classified as thalasseus maximus , which places it with five other seabirds from the tern family .
16  the royal tern was originally placed in the genus sterna; however , a 2005 study suggest that it is actually part of the genus thalasseus .
17  the royal tern is currently divided into two subspecies: thalasseus maximus maximus and thalasseus maximus albididorsalis .
18  t .
19  m .
20  maximus is found on the east coast of north america and is referred to as the "new world" species .
21  t .
22  m .
23  albidorsalis , referred to as the "old world" species , is found on the atlantic coast of north america , the caribbean islands , the east coast of south america , and in the west coast of africa .
24 ==description==this is a large tern , second only to caspian tern but is unlikely to be confused with the carrot-billed giant , which has extensive dark under wing patches .
25  the royal tern has an orange-red bill , pale grey upper parts and white under parts .
26  its legs are black .
27  in winter , the black cap becomes patchy .
28  juvenile royal terns are similar to non-breeding adults .
29  differences include juveniles having black splotched wings and a yellower bill .
30  an adult royal tern has an average wingspan of {convert|130|cm|in|abbr=on}, for both sexes , but their wingspan can range from {convert|125||135|cm|in|abbr=on} .
31  the royal tern's length ranges from {convert|45||50|cm|in|abbr=on} and their average weight is anywhere from {convert|350||450|g|oz|abbr=on} .
32 the calls of the royal tern are usually short , clear shrills .
33  some of the shrills sound like kree or tsirr; the royal tern also has a more plover like whistle that is longer , rolling and is more melodious .
34 in various parts of its range , the royal tern could be confused with the elegant tern , lesser crested tern (the other orange-billed terns), and the greater crested tern .
35  it is paler above than lesser crested tern and the yellow-billed great crested tern .
36  the elegant tern has a longer more curved bill and shows more white on the forehead in winter .
37 ==habitat and range==in the americas , the royal terns on the east coast , during the breeding season (april to july), occur in the us north to virginia , occasionally drifting north to maryland .
38  the southern end of their breeding range is texas .
39  the wintering range for on the east coast is from north carolina south to panama and the guianas , also the caribbean islands .
40  on the western coast of the americas , the royal tern spends the breeding season from the us state of california to mexico , wintering from california south to peru .
41 in africa , the royal tern is found along the west coast in the islands off the coast of mauritania during the breeding season , but it is believed that there are undiscovered colonies on the west coast near or in nigeria .
42  the royal tern usually winters from morocco south to namibia .
43  the royal tern is not usually found in europe although it has been seen in spain and gibraltar .
44  there have also been unconfirmed sightings farther north in europe .
45 american birds migrate south to peru and argentina for the winter to escape the cold weather .
46  african breeders move both north and south from the breeding colonies .
47  african birds may reach as far north as spain .
48  this species has also wandered to western europe as a rare vagrant , these terns are probably from the american colonies .
49 ==behavior=====feeding===the royal tern typically feeds in small secluded bodies of water such as estuaries , mangroves , and lagoons .
50  also , but less frequently , the royal terns will hunt for fish in open water , typically within about {convert|100|m|yd|abbr=off} off the shore .
51  the royal tern feeds in salt water and on very rare occasions in fresh water .
52  when feeding they fly long distances from the colony to forage .
53  the royal tern feeds by diving into the water from heights near {convert|30|ft|m|abbr=off} .
54  they usually feed alone or in groups of two or three , but on occasion they feed in large groups when hunting large schools of fish .
55 the royal tern usually feeds on small fish such as anchovies , weakfish , and croakers .
56  fish are their main source of food but they also eat insects , shrimp , and crabs .
57  the royal tern feeds on small crabs , such as young blue crabs that swim near the surface of the water .
58  when feeding on small crabs the royal tern does not use its normal plunge-dive technique , but instead uses short shallow dives so that they are concealed from their prey .
59  the royal tern also uses this technique when hunting flying fish .
60 ===reproduction===the royal tern nests on island beaches or isolated beaches with limited predators .
61  it lays one or two eggs , usually in a scrape , an area on the ground where a tern has made a small hole to lay its eggs .
62  in some cases , tern eggs are laid directly on the ground , not in a scrape .
63  the eggs incubate from 25 to 30 days; after the eggs hatch the chicks remain in the scrape for about a week .
64  about two weeks after hatching the chicks gather into groups called a crche .
65  when the chicks are in the crche , they are primarily fed by their parents who recognize their offspring by their voice and looks .
66  while the chicks are in the crche , they usually roam freely around the colony .
67  in a large colony there can be thousands of chicks in the crche .
68  when the chicks are a month old they fledge or start to fly .
69  royal terns mature around the age of 4 years , after which they build their own nests and reproduce .
70 like all white terns , it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young .
71  the royal tern and the cayenne tern nest and breed together in argentina and brazil .
72 ==threats==the royal tern has few predators when it is mature , but before the chicks hatch or while they are chicks the tern is threatened by humans , other animals , and the tides .
73  humans threaten terns by fishing and by disrupting the tern nesting sites .
74  fishing nets can catch a tern while it is diving , making it unable to feed or it may cause it to drown if it is caught under water .
75  animals such as foxes , raccoon , and large gulls prey on tern chicks and tern eggs .
76  tern nesting sites can also be affected by the tides; if a tern colony has nested to close to the high tide mark a spring tide would flood the nesting site and kill the chicks and make unhatched eggs infertile .
77 ==conservation==the royal tern is one of the species addressed in the agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory water birds (aewa) .
78  the aewa covers 255 species that depend on wetlands for part of their life .
79  the aewa covers birds from 64 countries in africa and eurasia .
80  there are little other conservation efforts because the royal tern's status is of least concern .
81  the reason there is little concern for the extinction of the royal tern is that the species has not experienced a significant enough decrease in population to become threatened or endangered .
