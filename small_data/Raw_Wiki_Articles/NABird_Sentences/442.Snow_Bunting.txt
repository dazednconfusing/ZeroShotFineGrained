0 the snow bunting (plectrophenax nivalis), sometimes colloquially called a snowflake , is a passerine bird in the calcariidae family  .
1  it is an arctic specialist , with a circumpolar arctic breeding range throughout the northern hemisphere .
2  there are small isolated populations on a few high mountain tops south of the arctic region , including the cairngorms in central scotland and the saint elias mountains on the southern alaska-yukon border , and also cape breton highlands .
3 [2] the snow bunting is the most northerly recorded passerine in the world .
4 [3]characteristicsthe snow bunting is a sexually dimorphic medium size passerine bird .
5 [4] this passerine is a ground-dwelling species that walks , runs and could potentially jump if needed .
6 [4] it is fairly large and long-winged for a bunting .
7  it measures 15 cm with a wingspan of 3238 cm (1315 in) and weights 30 to 40 grams .
8 [2][4][5] the bill is yellow with a black tip , and is all black in summer for males .
9  the plumage is white in the underparts and the wings and back have black and white on them .
10 [4] the female and male have a different plumage .
11  during the mating season: the male is completely black and white with black tips in the wings , while the female will have the same coloration than the male in the wings but will have a red-brownish color in her back .
12 [4] during the winter season they will both have a rufous coloration in the back .
13 [4] in the spring , the buntings will not go through a molt as other passerines birds do , instead the breeding coloration comes with the wearing and abrasion of the feathers .
14 [4] unlike most passerines , it has feathered tarsi , an adaptation to its harsh environment .
15  no other passerine can winter as far north as this species apart from the common raven .
16 [2][5]this species is often confused with the mckays bunting (plectrophenax hyperboreus) due to the similar coloration of their plumage .
17 [4] even more , the challenge of identification becomes harder when this two species hybridize in the boundaries of their territories .
18 [4] another similar species is the horned lark , although it has a larger black tail and it has a smaller white patch on the wings .
19 [6]taxonomythe snow bunting was formally part of the emberizidae family that includes american sparrows , buntings , towhees and finches .
20 [4][7] this family was formed after a broad geologically recent radiation of passerine birds .
21 [4] however , it is now part of the calcariidae family which contains the longspurs .
22 [4] despite the wide distribution of this species there is no a significant difference that exists among different phenotypes .
23 [4]there are four subspecies , which differ slightly in the plumage pattern of breeding males:[2]plectrophenax nivalis nivalis (linnaeus , 1758): arctic europe , arctic north america .
24  head white , rump mostly black with a small area of white .
25 plectrophenax nivalis insulae (salomonsen , 1931): iceland , faroe islands , scotland .
26  head white with a blackish collar , rump black .
27 plectrophenax nivalis vlasowae (portenko , 1937): arctic asia .
28  head white , rump mostly white .
29 plectrophenax nivalis townsendi (ridgway , 1887): aleutian islands , kamchatka , coastal far eastern siberia .
30  as vlasowae , but slightly larger .
31 it is very closely related to the beringian mckay's bunting , which differs in having even more white in the plumage .
32  hybrids between the two occur in alaska ,[2][8] and they have been considered conspecific by some authors ,[9] though they are generally treated as separate species .
33 [10]the species also mated with a lapland longspur creating a hybrid .
34  the first photographs of this hybrid were taken in april 2011, during its spring migration .
35 [11]habitat and distributionthe snow bunting lives in very high latitudes in the arctic tundra .
36 [12] there is no apparent limit to its northern range , while the southern range is limited by the duration of daylight , which influences their reproductive activity .
37 [12] this species is found in the high arctic tundra of north america , ellesmere island , iceland , higher mountains of scotland , norway , russia , north greenland , siberia , novaya zemlya , and franz josef land .
38 [13][14] during the winter , this bird migrates to the circumglobal northern temperate zone including the south of canada , north of the united states , north of germany , poland , ukraine , and east to central asia .
39 [3][5] during the last ice age , the snow bunting was widespread throughout continental europe .
40 [15]snow bunting young using a building as protectionthe same chicks eight days laterduring the breeding period the snow bunting looks for rocky habitats in the arctic .
41 [4] since the vegetation in the tundra is low growing , this bird and its nestlings are exposed to predators , and in order to ensure the survival of its offspring , the snow bunting nests in cavities in order to protect the nestlings from any threat .
42 [16] during this period , buntings also look for a habitat rich in vegetation such as wet sedge meadows and areas rich in dryas and lichens .
43 [4] in the winter , they look for open habitats such as farms and fields where they feed on seeds in the ground .
44 [17]migrationthe snow buntings migrate to the arctic to reproduce and they are the first migrant species that arrives to these territories .
45 [4] they must gain at least 30% of body mass before migration .
46 [4] the males will arrive first at the beginning of april , when temperature could reach -30 degrees celsius .
47 [4] this early migration could be explained by the fact that this species is highly territorial and the quality of the nesting area is crucial to their reproductive success .
48 [4] females will arrive four to six weeks later , when the snow starts to melt .
49 [4] they tend to migrate in small flocks and have an undulate flight at a moderate height .
50 [4]this passerine bird overwinters in northern temperate zones in open fields forming moving flocks .
51 [2][4] they will leave the arctic at the middle and end of september , although some will start the migration at the beginning of november .
52 [4] the female leaves first and tends to winter in more southern territories than the male , while the juveniles will leave the arctic even later than the adults .
53 [4]the migration of this bird is nocturnal and they are able to detect the geomagnetic field of the earth in order to guide themselves to their breeding and overwinter territory .
54 [3] the orientation of the snow bunting during migration is independent of any type of visual cue .
55 [18] furthermore , studies have shown that only does individuals with adequate energy storage will be able to select seasonally appropriate directions during their migration .
56 [18]behaviorfrom the fall to the spring the snow bunting will eat a variety of weeds such as knotweed , ragweed , amaranth , goosefoot , aster , and goldenrod and will also eat different types of grass seeds .
57 [4] during this season it will forage in the snow collecting seeds from lower stems .
58 [4] on the other hand , during the summer their diet will include seeds of crowberry , bilberry , bistort , dock , poppy , purple saxifrage and invertebrates such as butterflies , true bugs , flies , wasps and spiders .
59 [4] the nestlings will be fed exclusively on invertebrates .
60 [4] snow buntings will also prey on basking spiders by throwing rocks around and less regularly they will try to catch invertebrates in the fly .
61 [4]vocalizationsthe call is a distinctive rippling whistle , per ,r ,r ,rit and the typical plectrophenax warble hudidi feet feet feew hudidi .
62 snow buntings use vocalizations to communicate among each other and males will have a song to attract the female .
63 [19] the communication calls are done by both the male and the female and they tend to be emitted in flight or in the ground , while the males will often emit the song from a perching position or in a flight display .
64 [4] the males will start singing as soon as they will reach the breeding grounds , and will stop once they find a mate .
65 [4] studies have shown that the quality and the rate at which a song is emitted affect the reproductive success of a male .
66 [20] the rate of a song measured by the number of strophes per minute is limited by the foraging needs of the male; therefore , a male that is able to sing more frequently shows that he is more successful and effective in his foraging behavior .
67 [20] the song becomes an indicator of the parental care qualities of the male , since having an effective foraging behavior will provide a better probability of survival of the nestlings .
68 [20] females will then choose their mates based on their song rate .
69 [20]within snow buntings , vocalizations in males are unique to each individual , although there is certain syllable sharing between one another .
70 [19] the uniqueness of each song reveals a capacity of recognition between individuals and has an effect in the individual fitness and reproductive success .
71 [19] the songs have duration of 2 seconds and have a frequency of 2 to 6 khz .
72 [20] each song is composed of similar and dissimilar figures that create different motifs that will alternate and repeat , resulting in a unique pattern for every male individual .
73 [20]reproductionsnow buntings have a monogamous behavior in which the males have a positive impact in the reproductive success of the female , although they are not essential to the survival of the nestling .
74 [21] the male will follow the female during her fertile period to make sure that she will not mate with any other male .
75 [21] the nest sites provide safety but bring other challenges to snow buntings , since in rock cracks and fissures the microclimate could be harsh , the incubation time might be longer for this species and there is a risk that the lower temperatures kill the embryo .
76 [4] to overcome this challenge , the male will bring food to the female during the incubation time , in this way she will be able to constantly control the temperatures of the nest microclimate improving the hatching success and reducing the incubation time .
77 [4]this passerine lays eggs as soon as the ambient temperature is above 0 degrees celsius[22] the eggs are blue-green , spotted brown , and hatch in 1213 days , and the young are already ready to fly after a further 1214 days .
78 [5]courtship behaviorthe courtship behavior of snow buntings varies in different parts of the world .
79 [14] in greenland , the male will have a threat display to ensure his territory .
80 [14] this display will consist of very loud calls , the male will lower its head down and will turn completely to face the new comer .
81 [14] the males will also have a ceremonial flight to attract the female , in which they will reach a height of 30 to 50 feet , then they will glide , they will sing the song very loudly and will then keep on singing from a perching position .
82 [14]effects of climate change in snow bunting populationsseveral index suggest that climate change could potentially have an important impact in the snow buntings populations .
83 [22] the arctic oscillation index (ao) is a regional climate index that helps to predict ecological processes .
84 [22] in the arctic , when the ao index is in a positive phase there are higher winter temperatures and precipitations , there are earlier and warmer springs and in the summer it is cloudy , humid and there are lower temperatures .
85 [22] usually the ao index tends to oscillate from a positive to a negative phase , but during the last past 40 years , the ao index has remained in the positive phase .
86 [22] studies have shown that warmer springs trigger an early breeding behavior in the snow buntings that mismatches the peak of their food sources , leading to a lower success rate of the hatchlings .
87 [22] even more , the higher temperatures will bring to the arctic other species that will compete with the snow bunting ,[22] it is also thought that higher temperatures might allow a better survival of second broods in the snow bunting species .
