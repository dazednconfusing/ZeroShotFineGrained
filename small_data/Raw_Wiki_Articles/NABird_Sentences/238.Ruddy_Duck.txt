0 the ruddy duck (oxyura jamaicensis) is a duck from north america and the andes mountains of south america , one of the stiff-tailed ducks .
1 descriptionthese are small , compact ducks with stout , scoop-shaped bills , and long , stiff tails they often hold cocked upward .
2  they have slightly peaked heads and fairly short , thick necks .
3  male ruddy ducks have blackish caps that contrast with bright white cheeks .
4  in summer , they have rich chestnut bodies with bright blue bills .
5  in winter , they are dull gray-brown above and paler below with dull gray bills .
6  females and first-year males are brownish , somewhat like winter males but with a blurry stripe across the pale cheek patch .
7  in flight , ruddy ducks show solidly dark tops of the wings.2the southern subspecies ferruginea is occasionally considered a distinct species.3 it is separable by its all-black face and larger size .
8  the subspecies andina has a varying amount of black coloration on its white face; it may in fact be nothing more than a hybrid population between the north american and the andean ruddy duck .
9  as the colombian population is becoming scarce , it is necessary to clarify its taxonomic status , because it would be relevant for conservation purposes .

11  they nest in dense marsh vegetation near water .
12  the female builds the nest out of grass , locating it in tall vegetation to hide it from predators .
13  a typical brood contains 5 to 15 ducklings.6 pairs form each year .
14 they are migratory and winter in coastal bays and unfrozen lakes and ponds .
15 these birds dive and swim underwater .
16  they mainly eat seeds and roots of aquatic plants , aquatic insects and crustaceans .
17 male on the left , female on the rightas a result of escapes from wildfowl collections in the late 1950s , they became established in great britain , from where they spread into europe .
18  this duck's aggressive courting behaviour and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native white-headed duck (oxyura leucocephala), of southern europe , caused concern amongst spanish conservationists .
