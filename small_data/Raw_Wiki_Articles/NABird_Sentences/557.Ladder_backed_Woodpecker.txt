0 the ladder-backed woodpecker (dryobates scalaris) is a north american woodpecker .
1 ==range and habitat==the ladder-backed woodpecker is fairly common in dry brushy areas and thickets and has a rather large range .
2  the species can be found year-round over the southwestern united states (north to extreme southern nevada and extreme southeastern colorado), most of mexico , and locally in central america as far south as nicaragua .
3 ==description==the ladder-backed woodpecker is a small woodpecker about 16.5 to 19 cm (6 to 7 inches) in length .
4  it is primarily colored black and white , with a barred pattern on its back and wings resembling the rungs of a ladder .
5  its rump is speckled with black , as are its cream-colored underparts on the breast and flanks .
6   southern populations have duskier buff breasts and distinctly smaller bills .
7  adult males have a red crown patch that is smaller in immatures and lacking in adult females .
8  the ladder-backed woodpecker is very similar in appearance to nuttall's woodpecker , but has much less black on its head and upper back , and the range of the two species only intersects a minimal amount in southern california and northern baja california .
9   hybrids are known .
10 ladder-backed woodpeckers nest in cavities excavated from tree trunks , or in more arid environments a large cactus will do .

12  the eggs are incubated by both sexes , but the nesting period and other details are unknown .
13 like most other woodpeckers the ladder-backed woodpecker bores into tree-trunks with its chisel-like bill to hunt for insects and their larva , but it also feeds on fruit produced by cacti .
