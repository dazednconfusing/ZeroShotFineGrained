0 ==description==cedar waxwings are a medium-sized bird approximately {convert|6| - |7|in|cm|abbr=on} long and weigh roughly {convert|30|g|abbr = on} .
1  they are smaller and more brown than their close relative , the bohemian waxwing (which breeds farther to the north and west) .
2  it is a "silky , shiny collection of brown , gray , and lemon-yellow , accented with a subdued crest , rakish black mask , and brilliant-red wax droplets on the wing feathers .
3 " these birds' most prominent feature is this small cluster of red wax-like droplets on tips of secondary flight feathers on the wings , a feature they share with the bohemian waxwing (but not the japanese waxwing) .
4  the wings are "broad and pointed , like a starling's .
5 " the tail is typically yellow or orange depending on diet .
6  birds that have fed on berries of introduced eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail feathers will have darker orange-tipped tail-feathers .
7  the tail is somewhat short , and square-tipped .
8  adults have a pale yellow belly .
9  the waxwing's crest often "lies flat and droops over the back of the head .
10 " it has a short and wide bill .
11  the waxwing's black mask has a thin white border .
12  immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks , and often do not have the black mask of the adults .
13  males and females look alike .
14 the flight of waxwings is strong and direct , and the movement of the flock in flight resembles that of a flock of small pale european starlings .
15  cedar waxwings fly at {convert|40|kph|abbr = on} and fly at an altitude of {convert|610|m|abbr = on} .
16 cedar waxwings are also known as the southern waxwing , canada robin , cedar bird , cherry bird , or recellet .
17 the oldest observed cedar waxwing was eight years and two months old .
18 ===vocalizations===the two common calls of these birds include very high-pitched whistles and buzzy trills about a half second long often represented as see or sree .
19  its call can also be described as "high , thin , whistles .
20 " they call often , especially in flight .
21 ==distribution and habitat==preferred habitat consists of trees at the edge of wooded areas , or "open" forests , especially those that provide access to berry sources as well as water .
22  they are frequently seen in fruiting trees .
23  waxwings are attracted to the sound of running water , and love to bathe in and drink from shallow creeks .
24  in urban or suburban environments , waxwings often favor parkland with well-spaced trees; golf courses , cemeteries , or other landscaping with well-spaced trees; bushes that provide berries; and a nearby water source such as a fountain or birdbath .
25  also look for them near farms , orchards , and gardens , particularly ones with fruiting trees or shrubs .
26 outside the breeding season , cedar waxwings often feed in large flocks numbering hundreds of birds .
27  this species is nomadic and irruptive , with erratic winter movements , though most of the population migrates farther south into the united states and beyond , sometimes reaching as far as northern south america .
28  they will move in huge numbers if berry supplies are low .
29  rare vagrants have reached western europe , and there are two recorded occurrences of cedar waxwing sightings in great britain .
30  individual bohemian waxwings will occasionally join large winter flocks of cedar waxwings .
31 ==behavior and ecology==cedar waxwings are sociable , seen in flocks year round .
32  they are non-territorial birds and "will often groom each other .
33 " they move from place to place depending on where they can find good sources of berries .
34 ===breeding===mating season for this bird begins around the end of spring and runs through late summer .
35  the male will do a "hopping dance" for the female .
36  if she is interested , she'll hop back .
37  during courtship the male and female will sit together and pass small objects back and forth , such as flower petals or an insect .
38  mating pairs will sometimes rub their beaks together affectionately .
39  the nest is a loose open cup built with grass and twigs , lined with softer materials and supported by a tree branch averaging {convert|2|to|6|m|ft|abbr = on} above ground but , at times , considerably higher .
40  it takes around five or six days for the female waxwing to build the nest and can take up to 2,500 trips back and forth .
41  sometimes the female will steal nest material from other species' nests to save time .
42  the outer diameter of the nest is approximately {convert|12|to|16|cm|abbr = on} .
43  usually 5 or 6 eggs are laid and the female incubates them for 11 to 13 days .
44  the eggs are oval shaped with a smooth surface and very little , if any , gloss .
45  the egg shells are of various shades of light or bluish grey with irregular , dark brown spots or greyish-brown splotches .
46  both parents build the nest and feed the young .
47  typically , there are one or two broods during the mating season .
48  young leave the nest about 14 to 18 days after hatching .
49 ===diet===the cedar waxwing eats berries and sugary fruit year-round , including "dogwood , serviceberry , cedar , juniper , hawthorn , and winterberry", with insects becoming an important part of the diet in the breeding season .
50  its fondness for the small cones of the eastern redcedar (a kind of juniper) gave this bird its common name .
51  they eat berries whole .
52  they sometimes fly over water to catch insects .
53 when the end of a twig holds a supply of berries that only one bird at a time can reach , members of a flock may line up along the twig and pass berries beak to beak down the line so that each bird gets a chance to eat .
54 sometimes , cedar waxwings will eat fruit that is overripe and has begun to ferment , intoxicating the bird .
55 ==conservation status==waxwings are evaluated as least concern on the iucn red list of endangered species .
56  populations are increasing in their range partly because fields are being allowed to grow into forests and shrublands , and fruiting trees like mountain ash are being planted as landscaping .
57  on the other hand , cedar waxwings do sometimes crash into windows , and get hit by cars while foraging along roadsides .
