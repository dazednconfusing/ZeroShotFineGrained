0 ==description==the northern waterthrush is a large new world warbler (and not a thrush , despite the name) .
1  it has a length of {convert|12||15|cm|in|abbr=on}, wingspan of {convert|21||24|cm|in|abbr=on} and weighs between {convert|13|and|25|g|oz|abbr=on} among standard measurements , the wing chord is {convert|6.8|to|8.2|cm|in|abbr=on}, the tail is {convert|4.5|to|5.7|cm|in|abbr=on}, the bill is {convert|1.1|to|1.2|cm|in|abbr=on} and the tarsus is {convert|1.9|to|2.3|cm|in|abbr=on} .
2  on the head , the crown is brown with a white supercilium .
3  the bill is pointed and dark .
4  the throat is lightly streaked brown to black with heavier streaking continuing onto the breast and flanks .

7  young birds have buff , rather than white underparts .
8 the only species bird watchers confuse with the northern waterthrush is the closely related louisiana waterthrush (parkesia motacilla), which has buff flanks , a buff undertail , and bright pink legs .

12  the roosts are often located in red mangrove habitats .
13 northern waterthrushes winter in 4 main habitats in puerto rico: white mangrove , red mangrove , black mangrove , and scrub .
14  males , which are larger and migrate earlier in spring , prefer to winter in white mangrove , and are able to maintain or gain weight through the winter .

16  waterthrushes wintering in red and black mangrove can maintain body weight through the winter but lose weight in scrub .
17 ===reproduction===the breeding habitat of the northern waterthrush is wet woodlands near water .
