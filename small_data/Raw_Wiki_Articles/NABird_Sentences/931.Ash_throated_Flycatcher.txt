0 the ash-throated flycatcher (myiarchus cinerascens) is a passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family .
1  it breeds in desert scrub , riparian forest , brushy pastures and open woodland from the western united states to central mexico .
2  it is a short-distance migrant , retreating from most of the u.s.
4  and northern and central mexico , spending the winter from southern mexico to honduras .
5  this bird is also prone to wander , with single birds often seen outside its normal breeding range as far away as the east coast of north america .
6 the nest is built in a tree cavity or similar natural or man-made hole , and the normal clutch is three or four eggs .
7 adult ash-throated flycatchers are {convert|19||20|cm|in|abbr=on} long and weigh {convert|24||31|g|oz|abbr=on} .
8  the upperparts are olive brown , with a darker head and short crest .
9  the breast is gray and the belly is a very pale yellow .
10  the brown tail feathers and wings have rufous outer webs , and there are two dull wing bars .
11  the sexes are similar .
12 the ash-throated flycatcher is separated from other confusingly similar myiarchus species by its calls , a burry kabrick and a rough prrt or wheer heard year-round .
13 this species is primarily an insectivore that flies from a perch to catch prey from the ground or from foliage in the undergrowth , less often from branches and trunks , hardly ever in midair .
14  unlike many other tyrant flycatchers , it often moves on to another perch rather than returning to the same one .
15  it also takes some fruit , especially in winter if insects are unavailable .
16  rarely , it takes small mammals and reptiles , which it kills by banging them against hard objects .
17 the flight has an easygoing , slightly bobbing pattern .
