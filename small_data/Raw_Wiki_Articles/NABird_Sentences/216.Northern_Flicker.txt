0 the northern flicker (colaptes auratus) is a medium-sized member of the woodpecker family .
1  it is native to most of north america , parts of central america , cuba , the cayman islands , and is one of the few woodpecker species that migrate .
2  there are over 100 common names for the northern flicker .
3  among them are: yellowhammer (as it's known as the state bird of alabama , not to be confused with the eurasian yellowhammer), clape , gaffer woodpecker , harry-wicket , heigh-ho , wake-up , walk-up , wick-up , yarrup , and gawker bird .
4  many of these names are attempts at imitating some of its calls .
5 taxonomythe northern flicker is part of the genus colaptes , which encompasses twelve new-world woodpeckers .
6  there are nine recognized subspecies and one extinct subspecies of c .
7  auratus .
8 [2] the existing subspecies were at one time considered separate species but they commonly interbred where ranges overlap and are now considered one species by the american ornithologists union .
9  whether or not they are separate species is a well-known example of the species problem .
10 the yellow-shafted flicker (colaptes auratus auratus) resides in eastern north america .
11  they are yellow under the tail and underwings and have yellow shafts on their primaries .
12  they have a grey cap , a beige face and a red bar at the nape of their neck .
13  males have a black moustache .
14  colaptes comes from the greek verb colapt , to peck .
15  auratus is from the latin root aurat , meaning "gold" or "golden" and refers to the bird's underwing .
16 as the state bird of alabama[3] it is known by the name "yellowhammer ," a term that originated during the american civil war to describe confederate soldiers from alabama .
17 [4]the red-shafted flicker (colaptes auratus cafer) resides in western north america .
18  they are red under the tail and underwings and have red shafts on their primaries .
19  they have a beige cap and a grey face .
20  males have a red moustache .
21  the scientific name , colaptes auratus cafer , is the result of an error made in 1788 by the german systematist , johann gmelin , who believed that its original habitat was in south africa among the xhosa people , then known as the "kaffir" people .

25  chrysocaulosusfemale , cubadescriptionadults are brown with black bars on the back and wings .
26  a mid-to-large-sized woodpecker measures 2836 cm (1114 in) in length and 4254 cm (1721 in) in wingspan .
27 [5][6] the body mass can vary from 86 to 167 g (3.0 to 5.9 oz) .
28 [7] among standard scientific measurements , the wing bone measures 12.217.1 cm (4.86.7 in), the tail measures 7.511.5 cm (3.04.5 in), the bill measures 2.24.3 cm (0.871.69 in) and the tarsus measures 2.23.1 cm (0.871.22 in) .
29  the largest-bodied specimens are from the northern stretches of the species range , such as alaska or newfoundland and labrador , whereas the smallest specimens come from grand cayman island .
30 [8] a necklace-like black patch occupies the upper breast , while the lower breast and belly are beige with black spots .
31  males can be identified by a black or red moustachial stripe at the base of the beak .
32  the tail is dark on top , transitioning to a white rump which is conspicuous in flight .
33 the subspecies plumage varies as described in taxonomy section .
34 call and flightthis bird's call is a sustained laugh , ki ki ki ki , more congenial than that of the pileated woodpecker .
35  one may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory .
36  like most woodpeckers , northern flickers drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense .
37  in such cases , the object is to make as loud a noise as possible , and thats why woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objects .
38 like many woodpeckers , its flight is undulating .
39  the repeated cycle of a quick succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable to a rollercoaster .
40 behavioraccording to the audubon guide , "flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground", probing with their beak , also sometimes catching insects in flight .
41  although they eat fruits , berries , seeds and nuts , their primary food is insects .
42  ants alone can make up 45% of their diet .
43  other invertebrates eaten include flies , butterflies , moths , beetles , and snails .
44  flickers also eat berries and seeds , especially in winter , including poison oak and ivy , dogwood , sumac , wild cherry and grape , bayberries , hackberries , and elderberries , and sunflower and thistle seeds .
45  flickers often go after ants underground (where the nutritious larvae live), hammering at the soil the way other woodpeckers drill into wood .
46  they have been observed breaking into cow patties to eat insects living within .
47  their tongues can dart out 50 mm (2.0 in) beyond the end of the bill to snare prey .
48  as well as eating ants , flickers have a behavior called anting , during which they use the acid from the ants to assist in preening , as it is useful in keeping them free of parasites .
49 habitatflickers may be observed in open habitats near trees , including woodlands , edges , yards , and parks .
50  in the western united states , one can find them in mountain forests all the way up to treeline .
51  northern flickers generally nest in holes in trees like other woodpeckers .
52  occasionally , they have been found nesting in old , earthen burrows vacated by belted kingfishers or bank swallows .
53  both sexes help with nest excavation .
54  the entrance hole is about 7.6 cm (3.0 in) in diameter , and the cavity is 3341 cm (1316 in) deep .
55  the cavity widens at bottom to make room for eggs and the incubating adult .
56  inside , the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for the eggs and chicks to rest on .
57  once nestlings are about 17 days old , they begin clinging to the cavity wall rather than lying on the floor .
58 lifespanthe oldest yet known "yellow-shafted" northern flicker lived to be at least 9 years 2 months old , and the oldest yet known red-shafted northern flicker lived to be at least 8 years 9 months old .
59  [9]reproductiontheir breeding habitat consists of forested areas across north america and as far south as central america .
60  they are cavity nesters who typically nest in trees but they will also use posts and birdhouses if sized and situated appropriately .
61  they prefer to excavate their own home although they will reuse and repair damaged or abandoned nests .
62  abandoned flicker nests create habitat for other cavity nesters .
63  flickers are sometimes driven from nesting sites by another cavity nester , the european starling .
64 it takes about 1 to 2 weeks to build the nest which is built by both sexes of the mating pairs .
65  the entrance hole is roughly 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) wide .
66 northern flicker feeding juvenile at nest cavity entrancea typical clutch consists of 6 to 8 eggs whose shells are pure white with a smooth surface and high gloss .
67  the eggs are the second largest of the north american woodpecker species , exceeded only by the pileated woodpecker's .
68  incubation is by both sexes for approximately 11 to 12 days .
69  the young are fed by regurgitation and fledge about 25 to 28 days after hatching .
70 wintering and migrationnorthern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents .
