0 swainson's thrush (catharus ustulatus), also called olive-backed thrush , is a medium-sized thrush .
1  it is a member of catharus genus and is typical of it in terms of its subdued coloration and beautiful voice .
2  swainson's thrush was named after william swainson , an english ornithologist .
3 the breeding habitat of swainson's thrush is coniferous woods with dense undergrowth across canada , alaska , and the northern united states; also , deciduous wooded areas on the pacific coast of north america .
4 these birds migrate to southern mexico and as far south as argentina .
5  the coastal subspecies migrate down the pacific coast of north america and winter from mexico to costa rica , whereas the continental birds migrate eastwards within north america (a substantial detour) and then travel southwards via florida to winter from panama to bolivia .
6  swainson's thrush is a very rare vagrant to western europe .
7  it has also occurred as a vagrant in northeast asia .
8 this species may be displaced by the hermit thrush where their ranges overlap .
9  possibly , the latter species adapts more readily to human encroachment upon its habitat .
10  at least in the winter quarters , swainson's thrush tends to keep away from areas of human construction and other activity .
11 ==description==this species is {convert|16||20|cm|in|abbr=on} in length .
12  the wingspan averages at {convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on} and the wing chord is {convert|8.7|-|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on} .
13  the bill measures {convert|1.5|-|1.9|cm|in|abbr=on} in length and the tarsus is {convert|2.5|to|3.1|cm|in|abbr=on} long .
14  this species' body mass can range from {convert|23|to|45|g|oz|abbr=on} .
15  this thrush has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of catharus thrushes .
16  adults are brown on the upperparts .
17  the underparts are white with brown on the flanks; the breast is lighter brown with darker spots .
18  they have pink legs and a light brown eye ring .
19  birds in the east are more olive-brown on the upperparts; western birds are more reddish-brown .
20  this bird's song is a hurried series of flute-like tones spiralling upwards .
21 ==diet==they forage on the forest floor , also in trees .
22  swainson's thrushes mainly eat insects , fruits and berries .
23  they make a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch .
24 ==subspecies==four subspecies are recognised , cathartus ustulatus alame , c .

38  there is a small area of overlap in the coast mountains .
39  recent molecular systematics work confirms that these two pairs of subspecies form two genetically distinct clades , referred to as the continental and coastal clades , which diverged during the late pleistocene era , probably about 10,000 years ago as the last ice age came to its end and habitats shifted across north america .
40 the genetic differences between the subspecies , and the circuitous migratory route of the continental birds , strongly suggest that these species underwent a rapid range expansion following the end of the last ice age , with populations originally summering in the south-east of north america expanding their ranges northwards and westwards as the ice retreated .
41  details of the molecular genetic analysis support the hypothesis of rapid expansion of both coastal and continental populations .
42  the current migratory routes of the continental birds , especially the western populations , are not optimal in ecological terms , and presumably represent an inherited , historical route pattern that has not yet adapted to the birds' modern population locations .
43 these results notwithstanding , analysis of mtdna cytochrome b and nadh dehydrogenase subunit 2 as well as nuclear -fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data shows that swainson's thrush is the most ancient north american species of its genus; it is not closely related to other catharus and the outward similarities with the other north american species are due to convergent evolution .
