0 the common redpoll (acanthis flammea) is a species of bird in the finch family .
1  it breeds somewhat further south than the arctic redpoll , also in habitats with thickets or shrubs .
2 ==taxonomy==the common redpoll was listed in 1758 by linnaeus in the 10th edition of his systema naturae under the binomial name fringilla flammea .
3  the word flammea comes from the latin flammeus meaning flammulated or flame-coloured .
4  the common redpoll was previously placed in the genus carduelis .
5  molecular phylogenetic studies showed that the arctic and common redpolls formed a distinct lineage , so the two species were grouped together in the resurrected genus acanthis .
6 ===subspecies===the nominate subspecies a .
7  f .
8  flammea , the mealy redpoll , breeds across the northern parts of north america and eurasia .
9  there is also an icelandic subspecies , the icelandic redpoll (a .
10  f .
11  islandica), and one that breeds in greenland and baffin island called the greenland redpoll (a .
12  f .
13  rostrata) .
14  many taxonomic authorities consider the lesser redpoll a subspecific form of the common redpoll .
15  together the iceland and greenland forms are sometimes known as 'northwestern redpolls' .
16  all forms migrate south into canada , northern usa , or eurasia .
17  these birds are remarkably resistant to cold temperatures and winter movements are mainly driven by the availability of food .
18  there are two distinct populations (one lighter , one darker) united in islandica , the relationships of which are unresolved .
19 ==description==the common redpoll is a small brownish-grey finch with dark streaks and a bright red patch on its forehead .
20  it has a black bib and two pale stripes on the wings .
21  males often have their breasts suffused with red .
22  it is smaller , browner and more streaked than the generally similar arctic redpoll , adults measuring between {convert|11.5|and|14|cm} in length and weighing between {convert|12|and|16|g} .
23  the rump is streaked and there is a broad dark brown streak across the vent .
24  it has brown legs , dark-tipped yellowish bills and dark brown irises .
25 ==similar species==the mealy redpoll is larger and paler than the lesser redpoll with which it often mixes , apparently without significant interbreeding though sympatry was established too recently to draw firm conclusions .
26  the male mealy redpolls are darker than the similarly sized arctic redpolls but the females are almost identical .
27 ==behaviour==the range of the common redpoll extends through northern europe and asia to northern north america , greenland and iceland .
28  it is a partial migrant , moving southward in late autumn and northward again in march and april .
29  its typical habitat is boreal forest of pines , spruces and larches .
30  it feeds mainly on seeds , principally birch and alder seed in the winter .
31 the common redpoll builds its nest low down in a tree or bush .
32  the nest has an outer layer of thin twigs , a middle layer of root fibres , fragments of juniper bark and lichens and an inner layer of down , willow buds and reindeer hair .
33  three to seven speckled eggs are laid and incubated by the female .
34  they hatch after about eleven days and the young fledge in about a further thirteen days .
