1 svg |range_map_caption={leftlegend|#ffff00|breeding range|outline=gray}{leftlegend|#0000ff|winter range|outline=gray} }}the black-throated gray warbler (setophaga nigrescens) is a passerine bird of the new world warbler family parulidae .
2  it is {convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on} long and has gray and white plumage with black markings .
3  the male has the bold black throat of its name , and black stripes on its head , as well as black streaks on its flanks; the female is a paler version of the male , with a white throat and less distinct black markings on the flanks and wings .
4  it breeds in western north america from british columbia to new mexico , and winters in mexico and the southwestern united states .
5  the habitats it prefers are coniferous and mixed forests and scrubland , especially those with pinyon pines , junipers , sagebrush , and oaks .
6  its nest is an open cup of plant fibers lined with feathers , built a few metres from the ground in the branches of a tree or shrub .
7  three to five eggs are laid , and young are fed by both parents .
8  common in its breeding range , it does not seem to be seriously threatened by human activities , unlike many migratory warblers .
9 == description ==the black-throated gray warbler has mostly black , gray , and white plumage , which is soft , lacking gloss .
10  with its striping and the small yellow spot between its eye and bill , it is a distinctive bird .
11  the sexes differ slightly , both having gray upperparts with black streaks , and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks .
12  the adult male is striped with a black on the crown , throat , and below the eye , and has white around its chin and above its eye .
13  the adult female has more dingy plumage on its head , with a white throat and dark gray cheeks .
14  the most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers , which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns .
15 it is typically {convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on} long , weighing {convert|8.4|g|oz|abbr=on} .
16  wing lengths are {convert|5.6||6.9|cm|in|abbr=on}, tail lengths {convert|4.7||5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}, bill lengths {convert|8.4||9.6|mm|in|abbr=on}, and tarsus lengths {convert|1.66||1.88|cm|in|abbr=on}, with females slightly smaller than males .
17 this bird gives a sharp tup or thick call , like that of townsend's warbler but flat and unmusical , as well as a high see flight call .
18  the male's song is a series of buzzy notes , with the earlier notes doubled and the next to last note high .
19  this song has three variations , including a quiet "soft song" given by the males while following females gathering material for a nest .
20 == taxonomy ==the black-throated gray warbler was first described by john kirk townsend from a specimen collected near today's portland , oregon .
21  it was known to the chinook inhabitants of the northwest coast , who called it ah kah a qual .
22  townsend described the species as sylvia nigrescens , placing it with the other new world warblers and the unrelated old world warblers in the genus sylvia .
23  it is now placed in the genus setophaga along with about thirty other species , after having been classified in dendroica for some time .
24  within its genus , it is part of a group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit warbler and townsend's warbler .
25  it is usually considered an early offshoot among this group of species , but genetic studies suggest a close relation to grace's warbler .
26 of these relatives , the range of the black-throated gray warbler overlaps with those of townsend's warbler and the hermit warbler , but they occur in different habitats .
27  while townsend's and hermit warblers commonly hybridize with each other , records of either species hybridizing with the black-throated gray warbler are uncommon .
28 there are two subspecies , which are highly similar and of dubious validity .
29  the nominate subspecies s .
30  n .
31  nigrescens occurs on the pacific coastal region from british columbia to northern california , while s .
32  n .
33  halseii , described by giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range .
34  s .
35  n .
36  halseii birds are slightly larger and more gray in their upperparts .
37 == distribution and habitat ==the black-throated gray warbler breeds in western north america , its range extending from southwestern british columbia along the pacific coast to northern baja california , and east to new mexico and southern montana .
38  it winters mostly in mexico , from southern baja california to oaxaca state .
39  it has spread into parts of wyoming and montana only recently , as juniperus osteosperma has expanded its range due to a warming climate .
40  vagrants have been recorded across eastern north america and in cuba .
41 the black-throated gray warbler breeds in open coniferous and mixed forest with a brushy understory , in dry open oak forests , and in chaparral and other scrubland .
42  it is particularly associated with pinyon pines , junipers , and oaks .
43  it migrates to the south late in the fall , returning north in mid-spring .
44  while migrating , it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through .
45  in its wintering grounds , it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub .
46  though its status is not well known , it does not appear to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities , unlike many migratory warblers .
47  it is a fairly common bird , among the most common in some localities .
48  because it is common and not in rapid decline , it is assessed as least concern on the iucn red list .
49 == behavior ==the black-throated gray warbler is usually approachable , and can easily be observed while foraging .
50  despite this , it is poorly known , especially in its breeding behavior , of which birds of north america said "almost no information is available" .
51  it forages , often in flocks with other species .
52  it feeds on insects gleaned on low branches , especially caterpillars .
53 the nest is usually placed on a horizontal tree branch or in a shrub , a few metres above the ground .
54  the nest is an open cup constructed of grass stalks and other fibres , and lined with feathers and hair .
55  the female lays three to five pinkish eggs with brown dots from may to july .
56  incubation and fledging periods are unknown .
57  this species has been recorded giving a distraction display , pretending to be injured to distract predators from its nest .
58  both parents feed the young , though the female may do so more frequently .
