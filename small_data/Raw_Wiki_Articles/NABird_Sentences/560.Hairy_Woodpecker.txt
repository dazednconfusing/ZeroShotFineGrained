0 the hairy woodpecker (picoides villosus) is a medium-sized woodpecker , averaging approximately {convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on} in length with a {convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on} wingspan .
1  with an estimated population in 2003 of over nine million individuals , the hairy woodpecker is listed by the iucn as a species of least concern in north america .
2 ==range==the hairy woodpecker inhabits mature deciduous forests in the bahamas , canada , costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , mexico , nicaragua , panama , puerto rico , saint pierre and miquelon , turks and caicos islands , and the united states .
3  mating pairs will excavate a hole in a tree , where they will tend to , on average , four white eggs .
4 ==description==adults are mainly black on the upper parts and wings , with a white or pale back and white spotting on the wings; the throat and belly vary from white to sooty brown , depending on subspecies .
5  there is a white bar above and one below the eye .
6  they have a black tail with white outer feathers .
7  adult males have a red patch or two side-by-side patches on the back of the head; juvenile males have red or rarely orange-red on the crown .
8 the hairy woodpecker measures from {convert|18|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on} in length , {convert|33|-|43|cm|in|abbr=on} in wingspan and {convert|40|-|95|g|oz|abbr=on} in weight .
9  it is virtually identical in plumage to the smaller downy woodpecker .
10  the downy has a shorter bill relative to the size of its head which is , other than size and voice , the best way to distinguish them in the field .
11  these two species are not closely related , however , and are likely to be separated in different genera .
12  the best way to tell the two species apart other than the size is the lack of spots on its white tail feathers (which the downy has) .
13  their outward similarity is a spectacular example of convergent evolution .
14  as to why this convergence has evolved , only tentative hypotheses have been advanced; in any case due to the considerable size difference , ecological competition between the two species is rather slight .
15 these birds are mostly permanent residents .
16  birds in the extreme north may migrate further south; birds in mountainous areas may move to lower elevations .
17 these birds forage on trees , often turning over bark or excavating to uncover insects .
18  they mainly eat insects , also fruits , berries and nuts , sometimes tree sap .
19  they are also known to peck at wooden window frames and wood sided homes that may house bugs .
