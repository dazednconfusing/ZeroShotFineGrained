Grus proavus

==Description==

Adults are gray overall; during breeding, their plumage is usually much worn and stained, particularly in the migratory populations, and looks nearly ochre. The average weight of the larger males is {convert|4.57|kg|lb|abbr=on}, while the average weight of females is {convert|4.02|kg|lb|abbr=on}, with a range of {convert|2.7|to|6.7|kg|lb|abbr=on} across the subspecies. Sandhill cranes have red foreheads, white cheeks, and long, dark, pointed bills. In flight, their long, dark legs trail behind, and their long necks keep straight. Immature birds have reddish-brown upperparts and gray underparts. The sexes look alike. Sizes vary among the different subspecies; the average height of these birds is around {convert|80|to|122|cm|ftin|abbr=on}. Their wing chords are typically {convert|41.8|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}, tails are {convert|10|-|26.4|cm|in|abbr=on}, the exposed culmens are {convert|6.9|-|16|cm|in|abbr=on} long, and the tarsi measure {convert|15.5|-|26.6|cm|in|abbr=on}.

These cranes frequently give a loud, trumpeting call that suggests a rolled "r" in the throat, and they can be heard from a long distance. Mated pairs of cranes engage in "unison calling". The cranes stand close together, calling in a synchronized and complex duet. The female makes two calls for every one from the male.

Sandhill cranes' large wingspans, typically {convert|1.65|to|2.29|m|ftin|abbr=on}, make them very skilled soaring birds, similar in style to hawks and eagles. Using thermals to obtain lift, they can stay aloft for many hours, requiring only occasional flapping of their wings and consequently expending little energy. Migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds, and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) they ride.

Sandhill cranes fly south for the winter. In their wintering areas, they form flocks over 10,000. One place this happens is at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, {Convert|100|miles|abbr = on} south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. An annual Sandhill Crane Festival is held there in November.

===Fossil record===

Sandhill cranes have one of the longest fossil histories of any extant bird. A 10-million-year-old crane fossil from Nebraska is said to be of this species, but this may be from a prehistoric relative or the direct ancestor of sandhill cranes and not belong in the genus Grus. The oldest unequivocal sandhill crane fossil is 2.5 million years old, older by half than the earliest remains of most living species of birds, primarily found from after the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary some 1.8 million years ago. As these ancient sandhill cranes varied as much in size as present-day birds, those Pliocene fossils are sometimes described as new species. Grus haydeni may have been a prehistoric relative, or it may comprise material of a sandhill crane and its ancestor.

===Subspecies and evolution===

Sandhill cranes considerably vary in size (much of which is clinal) and in migratory habits. A female of G. c. canadensis averages {Convert|3.46|kg|abbr = on}, {convert|37|in|cm|abbr=on} in length and has a wingspan of {Convert|1.6|m|abbr = on}. A male of G. c. tabida averages {Convert|5|kg|abbr = on}, {Convert|119|cm|abbr = on} in length and has a wingspan of {Convert|2.12|m|abbr = on}. The southern subspecies (along with G. c. rowani) are intermediate, roughly according to Bergmann's rule.

Three subspecies are resident: G. c. pulla of the Gulf Coast of the U.S., G. c. pratensis of Florida and Georgia and G. c. nesiotes of Cuba. The northern populations exist as fragmented remains in the contiguous U.S. and a large and contiguous population from Canada to Beringia. These migrate to the southwestern United States and Mexico. These cranes are rare vagrants to China, South Korea, and Japan and very rare vagrants to western Europe.

Six subspecies have been recognized in recent times:

The Florida sandhill crane was listed as EC or easily confused to facilitate an attempted reintroduction of the whooping crane (Grus americana) into Florida. The attempt failed, but the listing remained. The current list of endangered subspecies includes only two birds, G. c. nesiotes and G. c. rowani, with G. c. pratensis no longer listed.

The Canadian sandhill cranes are not distinct and were never accepted as a valid subspecies. The others can be somewhat more reliably distinguished in hand by measurements and plumage details, apart from the size differences already mentioned. Unequivocal identification often requires location information, which is often impossible in migrating birds.
