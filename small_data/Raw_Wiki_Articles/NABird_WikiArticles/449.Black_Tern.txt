In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season, hence the old English name "blue darr". The scientific name means "like a swallow".

== Description ==

Adults are {convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on} long, with a wingspan {convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}, and weigh {convert|62|g|oz|abbr=on}. They have short dark legs and a short, weak-looking black bill, measuring {convert|27|mm|in|abbr=on}, nearly as long as the head. The bill is long, slender, and looks slightly decurved. They have a dark grey back, with a white forewing, black head, neck (occasionally suffused with grey in the adult) and belly, black or blackish-brown cap (which unites in color with the ear coverts, forming an almost complete hood), and a light brownish-grey, 'square' tail. The face is white. There is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye, and a broadish white collar in juveniles. There are greyish-brown smudges on the ides of the white breast, a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts. These marks vary in size and are not conspicuous. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black, apart from the cap, is replaced by grey. The plumage of the upperparts is drab, with pale feather-edgings. The rump is brownish-grey.

The North American race, C. n. surinamensis, is distinguishable from the European form in all plumages, and is considered by some to be a separate species.

In flight, the build appears slim. The wing-beats are full and dynamic, and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food; similar to other tern species.

Its call has been described as a high-pitched "kik";  the sound of a large flock has been called  "deafening".

== Hybridisation with white-winged black tern ==

Hybridisation between this species and white-winged black tern has been recorded from Sweden and the Netherlands. Two juvenile birds at Chew Valley Lake, England, in September 1978 and September 1981, were also believed to be hybrids; they showed mixed characters of the two species, specifically a combination of a dark mantle (a feature of white-winged black) with dark patches on the breast-side (a feature of black tern, not shown by white-winted black).

== Distribution and habitat ==

Their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across most of Canada, the northern United States and much of Europe and western Asia. They usually nest either on floating material in a marsh or on the ground very close to water, laying 2â€“4 eggs.

In England  the black tern was abundant in the  eastern fens, especially in  Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire,  until the early nineteenth century.  The  English naturalist  Thomas Pennant   in 1769 referred to   "vast flocks"  of black terns  "whose calls are almost deafening".  Extensive drainage of its breeding grounds wiped out the English  population by about 1840. Intermittent attempts by the species  to recolonise England  have proved unsuccessful, with only a handful of English  breeding records, and one in Ireland,  in the second half of the twentieth century.
